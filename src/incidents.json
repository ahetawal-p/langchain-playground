        "details": "While engaged in fire fighting water-dropping operations, the helicopter impacted high tension power transmission wires and fell to the ground under marginal control.  The pilot and helicopter were reassigned from another nearby base on the morning of the accident and, at the time of the wire strike, the pilot was engaged in his first operational sortie in the new area.  Prior to takeoff the pilot had been briefed about wire hazards in the area.  A topographical map that was used in the briefing showed high power transmission wires, including the set the pilot later impacted, as red lines.  After takeoff, the pilot proceeded to the fire area and made an initial drop on the fire.  It was while returning to the dip site to refill that the wire strike occurred.  The pilot reported that as he approached the dip site at 250 - 300 feet agl, he was aware of a power transmission tower high on the mountain to his right, well above him.  He was also aware of another tower to his left on the valley floor below and an electrical powerhouse on the valley floor nearly in front of him.  He thought that the wires from both the tower on his right and the tower on his left went to the powerhouse and were beneath him.  In fact, the wires were strung directly from the tower above him, on the right, to the lower tower, on his left, and crossed his flight path at the helicopter's altitude.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and smoke was not present in the area of the accident.  Flights flown after the accident in like conditions of daylight and visibility showed the wires could not be visually detected until the helicopter was 'extremely close to the wires.'   Probable Cause: The failure of the pilot-in-command to maintain adequate visual surveillance to see and avoid power transmission wires known to be in the area."

The pilot said that during descent, the \"cylinder number 1 failed, followed immediately by the failure of cylinder number 2, and within about 4 seconds a total seizure of the engine.\" The pilot made a forced landing in an alfalfa field, subsequently impacting a berm and substantially damaging the airplane. The engine was later disassembled and examined. The engine had seized and could not be turned because connecting rods 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9 were found broken, and numbers 5 and 6 were found severely damaged. Connecting rod 8 was not broken or damaged. Metal contamination was noted in the push rod housings, oil sump, thrust cover and bearing; cam, cam rollers, cam drive gear and inspection hole; main case, and oil screen. According to the FAA inspector, there were indications that the #7 connecting rod had struck the crankcase between #6 and #7 cylinders, breaking the through bolts.  Probable Cause: failure of the #7 connecting rod, causing engine seizure. A contributing factor was the berm."

The aircraft stalled at the end of the runway, at treetop level, subsequently impacting the trees and terrain.  The pilot reported that he selected 10-degrees of flaps for the takeoff.  The Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH) for the accident aircraft indicates that 25-degrees of flap is to be used for short-field takeoffs that have obstacles and that the landing gear to be retracted after lift-off.  Post-accident investigation revealed that the landing gear was fully extended and the flaps were at 10-degrees (first notch). According to the POH, utilizing a calculated density altitude of 2,785-feet and 25-degrees of flaps used during the takeoff, the distance to clear a 50-foot obstacle was approximated at 2,250-feet.  Utilizing the same density altitude but 0-degrees of flaps used for the takeoff, the distance to clear a 50-feet obstacle was approximated at 2,500-feet. The takeoff calculations were based on a takeoff from a paved, dry, level runway and at the aircraft's certified maximum gross weight of 2,600-lbs.  Probable Cause: altitude/clearance from the trees not being obtained/maintained by the pilot during the initial climb after takeoff. Factors to the accident were the inadequate preflight planning/preparation by the pilot, including takeoff performance data not being calculated, the correct procedures/directives for a short field takeoff with obstacles not being followed by the pilot, the trees, and the encountered stall."

The airplane descended into a field about 2 miles away from his departure airstrip.  The pilot stated the airplane contacted the ground then slid into trees, damaging the right wing.   A post accident examination of the airplane revealed the fabric on the right wing had separated from the ribs.  No other failures/malfunctions with the wing were noted.  The pilot reported the fabric is glued to 1-inch rib caps in the wings.  He also reported that it appeared as if the fabric had pulled away from the caps.  The airplane was constructed in 1985 and it had been flown about 300 hours prior to the accident.  The pilot reported the last annual inspection of the airplane was in April, 2004, and the airplane had been flown 4 hours since that inspection.  Probable Cause: The separation of the wing skin from the wing structure and the pilot's subsequent inablility to maintain aircraft control.  A factor associated with the accident was the tree that the airplane contacted."

As the motorglider descended, the pilot was able to level the wings, but was 90 degrees to the runway and 'into the trees.'  The pilot raised the nose of the glider to decrease airspeed, and the motorglider stalled, impacting trees short of the runway. The winds reported by an airport located about 13 miles east of the accident were from 350 degrees at 7 knots.  Probable Cause: The pilot's inadequate compensation for crosswind conditions.  A factor in the accident was the cross wind."

The new owner performed a detailed preflight inspection and repetitive run up checks prior to departure, with no mechanical anomalies noted. After takeoff, the pilot climbed to about 600 feet above the ground, flew straight for approximately 2 miles, then turned to the left. During the turn, the pilot noted a low frequency vibration, and an \"unusual back pressure on the cyclic.\" Coming out of the turn, back pressure to the cyclic increased. Indicated airspeed was 75 mph, and all gauges were \"in the green.\" As the helicopter continued straight and level, back pressure continued to increase, requiring more forward cyclic to maintain airspeed and level flight. The pilot climbed, and turned back toward the departure point. After the turn, the helicopter initiated an uncommanded nose up attitude and rolled to the left, with the nose then dropping so low that the pilot was looking at the ground. The pilot arrested the turn utilizing collective and throttle, and by \"forcibly\" pulling and pushing on the cyclic as needed. He then performed a \"quasi-controllable\" autorotation to the ground, landing on the skids, heading down-slope on a hill, with no forward or side motion. The helicopter subsequently rolled over on its right side, and fuel ignited as the pilot exited through the broken windshield. Due to the helicopter being consumed in the postcrash fire, a thorough examination was not possible. Probable Cause: A loss of control for undetermined reasons."

The crew did not experience any control issues or anomalous behavior initially but continued to troubleshoot. As they were approaching 10,000 ft mean sea level, they noticed that the cabin altitude was also approaching 10,000 ft, so they leveled off and determined that they had a pressurization problem. After conferring with their flight operations and maintenance department, they notified air traffic control and diverted to a suitable airport and landed safely. Upon subsequent inspection it was revealed that a bird had penetrated the right side of the nose under the first officer's window. The impact ruptured the fuselage and resulted in substantial airframe damage."

The pilot allowed rotor rpm to decrease, and he erroneously entered an autorotation rather than performing the prescribed immediate landing while being prepared for the possibility of an autorotative descent.  The subsequent wreckage examination revealed one of the two rotor system drive (vee) belts had broken.  The second belt was intact, with the lower section of the belt found on the lower pulley in the correct position.  The upper section of the belt on the upper pulley was found shifted forward one groove on the pulley.     Probable Cause: The pilot's misjudged landing flare during an autorotation, which resulted in a hard landing.  The pilot's failure to follow the listed emergency procedures in the rotorcraft flight manual and the partial failure of the rotor system's drive belts were factors."

The student turned the helicopter into the wind but lost 15 knots and rotor rpm (96 percent). The instructor noticed the rpm drop and added power, but there was no increase in rpm. Altitude had dropped to 4,900 feet msl (300 feet agl), and the rate of descent was increasing. The instructor kept the collective control down and pulled back on the cyclic control to transfer speed into rotor rpm and altitude. Engine and rotor rpm needles \"were married at 93% and 95%.\" He increased collective to reduce the rate of descent. The throttle was fully open. The low rotor rpm horn never shut off, and there was no audible increase in rpm. The instructor said that as they passed 50 feet agl, the rpm was so low that \"the helicopter was close to stall.\" He leveled off, but the helicopter struck the ground and bounced several times, collapsing the skids. It rolled over on its left side, shearing off the main rotor and tail rotor blades. The fuselage skin was also wrinkled. Nothing was found that would have precluded the development of engine power. Based on an instructor interview,the FAA concluded that the flight instructor should have had the student make a straight ahead autorotation instead of a turning autorotation. The student allowed rpm to drop so that it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to recover.  Probable Cause: The loss of power for undetermined reasons.  Also causal was the student's failure to maintain aircraft control and the instructor's inadequate supervision.  The instructor's delayed remedial action as a contributing factor."

        "details": "A Beech Hawker BH 125-600A executive jet, registered N454DP, was damaged after it was forced to land with the landing gear retracted at Las Vegas-McCarran International Airport, NV (LAS).During the departure from Salina Airport, KS (SLN) about 16:00, the pilots felt a vibration at rotation. They thought the nose wheel was in the air with the main landing gear still on the ground and they believed they might have blown a tire. Once the airplane lifted off, a normal vibration replaced the violent one, and gear retraction was normal. Ten minutes after departure the right hydraulic low flow light illuminated with the pressure gauge reading 2,300 psi. The crew reviewed the airplane's flight manual, which stated no immediate crew action was required, but emergency braking would probably have to be used. Approximately 10 minutes later, the left hydraulic low flow light illuminated, and the pressure gauge continued to indicate 2,300 psi. The pilots said the airplane flight manual indicated no immediate crew action was required, but now the emergency landing gear extension system (the auxiliary hydraulic system) and emergency braking would need to be used. Since they needed to burn fuel to lower their landing weight, they decided to continue to Las Vegas. If they had any complications, they thought they would have more support equipment available there.The crew advised air traffic control of their problem as they arrived in the Las Vegas area. The hydraulic pressure gauge was still reading 2,300 psi and they tried to deploy the gear normally. The pilot stated he usually felt a slight pressure as the gear handle moved and actuated a valve, but this time he felt nothing and the gear did not deploy. The UC (undercarriage control) handle was pulled but with some difficulty. The crew stated they attempted to pump the gear down manually, but after a few strokes the auxiliary hydraulic low-pressure warning light illuminated. The gear doors did not open and they felt no pressure as they pumped the auxiliary system. The crew repeated the emergency procedures several times as they attempted to lower the landing gear. When all attempts failed, the pilots individually went to the cabin and briefed the passengers on emergency egress in case of crew incapacitation.The crew discussed the landing and notified the tower of their intentions. They circled to burn off fuel and decided to attempt the landing with approximately 500 pounds of fuel remaining in each wing tank. The crew instructed the passengers to assume a brace position 30 seconds prior to touchdown. The pilot estimated the speed on short final approach for runway 19L was 130 knots, touchdown was at 110 knots, and the flaps were up. As the airplane flew into ground effect, the crew secured the engines and electrical system. On touchdown, they secured the fuel control and the pilot saw flames over his shoulder. The airplane skidded on the ground about twice as far as the crew expected. It came to rest at the intersection of runway 19L and runway 25R. Flames were on the right side of the airplane; however, the entry door on the left side opened normally and everyone exited the airplane through it."

The aircraft sustained substantial damage; however, neither of the 2 flight crewmembers nor any of their 12 passengers were injured. The flight originated from Pago Pago, American Samoa, at 06:09 as a regularly scheduled non-stop domestic passenger flight to Fitiuta. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and a composite IFR/VFR flight plan was filed.The captain overflew the Fitiuta airfield to assess winds conditions and the windsock indicated a quartering headwind for runway 12. During rollout the airplane veered immediately right when the power levers were brought into beta. The captain corrected with rudder and braking but was unable to maintain directional control. The aircraft ran off the right side of the runway and collided with a ditch and an embankment. After deplaning, the crew found that the winds were a 60-degree tailwind on runway 12. The windsock's pivot point on the pole was rusted and would not rotate. The aircraft with the same landing weight and a 60-degree 10-knot tailwind would require a 1,600-foot landing roll on the 2,350-foot runway without the assistance of both props in beta. The beta pin had backed out of position on the left engine's beta control linkage. The beta pin, cotter pin, and washer were found in the bottom of the engine cowling. The left engine had been changed 2 days prior to the accident. As the mechanics finished the beta pin area during engine installation, the inspector checked the area and found that the pin was in place and properly safety wired. Following the inspector's signoff of the area, the mechanics discovered that the teleflex cable was too short for the beta valve to be flushed and subsequently had to be adjusted. The director of maintenance readjusted the cable, which required disturbing the safety wire on the beta pin. One of the two mechanics that had been instructed to re-safety the connections after the adjustment thought that the rear portion had already been safetied and did not recheck the area. The inspector believed the area had already been checked and did not re-examine the beta pin."

As the flight approached the alternate airport, the weather had deteriorated, and the pilot requested a Special VFR clearance. The flight continued to follow the lake shoreline and the pilot recalled circling once while waiting for the clearance.   Prior to reaching 'the mouth of the river', the pilot made the decision to divert to another alternate airport, due to the visibility getting worse as they approached the airport. As the pilot began to make an approximate 20° right hand turn over the frozen, snow-covered lake, he noticed the airplane was losing altitude and remembers increasing power and pitch, around this point he 'switched to instruments'. The passenger recalled looking to his right and remarked it was like looking at a 'white sheet of paper' with the sky blending with the frozen lake. Moments later, the airplane impacted the snow-covered ice while in the turn to the right.   The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings, fuselage, and empennage. The operator reported that there were no mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.  Probable Cause: The pilot's decision to continue visual flight into an area of instrument meteorological conditions, which resulted in the pilot experiencing a loss of visual reference and subsequent controlled flight into terrain."

        "details": "On March 3, 2023, about 1600 eastern standard time, a Bombardier BD-100-1A10 (Challenger 300) airplane, N300ER, was involved in an accident while en route from Dillant/Hopkins Airport (EEN), Keene, New Hampshire to Leesburg Executive Airport (JYO), Leesburg, Virginia. The flight diverted to Bradley International Airport (BDL), Windsor Locks, Connecticut. One passenger was fatally injured. The two airline transport pilots and two other passengers were not injured. The airplane was not damaged and was operated as a personal flight under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.  The flight crew reported that after a routine preflight inspection, engine start, and taxi for departure, a takeoff was initiated. The second-in-command (SIC) reported that during the takeoff roll on runway 2, the airplane accelerated normally, however, he observed that the right primary flight display (PFD) airspeed indicator mis-compared to the left side airspeed indicator and an aborted takeoff was performed. The pilot-in-command (PIC) slowed the airplane without issue and exited the runway onto a taxiway. The left engine was shutdown, the SIC opened the main cabin door and walked to the front of the airplane where he subsequently observed that the red pitot probe cover remained installed on the right-side pitot probe. The SIC removed the cover, did not see any damage to the probe, and returned to the cockpit.  The PIC restarted the left engine and resumed the taxi to runway 2. Shortly after the left engine was started, the crew reported that an Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System (EICAS) advisory message of ‘RUDDER LIMITER FAULT’ annunciated. The PIC reported that he attempted two ground avionics “stall tests” to clear the message, as he had received this advisory message in past ground operations, however, the tests did not clear the annunciation. The flight was continued given that the message was an advisory, and not a caution or warning.  The flight crew further reported that during the second takeoff, the acceleration was normal, however, the SIC noticed that the V-speeds were not set. The SIC called V1 and rotate at 116 knots from memory and the PIC entered the climb without issue. As the initial climb and turn on course progressed, the PIC reported that the autopilot was engaged, and they continued a climb to 6,000 ft mean sea level (msl) and were subsequently cleared to flight level 240 (24,000 ft msl). The flight crew reported that around 6,000 ft, they observed multiple EICAS caution messages. The crew recalled EICAS messages of ‘AP STAB TRIM FAIL’ [autopilot stabilizer trim failure] ‘MACH TRIM FAIL’ and ‘AP HOLDING NOSE DOWN’. Neither crewmember could recall exactly what order the EICAS messages were presented. They also reported that additional EICAS messages may have been annunciated.  The PIC asked the SIC to refer to the quick reference handbook. The SIC, via an electronic flight bag (iPad), located the quick reference card and the ‘PRI STAB TRIM FAIL’ [Primary Stabilizer Trim Failure] checklist. The SIC visually showed the PIC the checklist, and they both agreed to execute the checklist. The first action on the checklist was to move the stabilizer trim switch (‘STAB TRIM’), located on the center console, from ‘PRI’ (Primary) to ‘OFF.’ The SIC read the checklist item aloud and he subsequently moved the switch to off.  As soon as the switch position was moved, the airplane abruptly pitched up. The PIC reported that his left hand was on the flight controls and his right hand was guarding the right side of the flight controls. He immediately with both hands regained control of the airplane in what he estimated to be a few seconds after the airplane’s pitch oscillated up and down. During the oscillations, the PIC instructed the SIC to move the stabilizer trim switch back to the primary position, which the SIC accomplished. The PIC reported that preceding the rapid pitch event, the autopilot was on, and he expected that once the stabilizer trim switch was turned off, the autopilot would disconnect, which it did.  The PIC reported that he had no problem manually flying the airplane after the in-flight upset, nor did he experience any abnormalities trimming the airplane using the manual pitch trim switch, located on the control column, at any point during the flight. Shortly after the in-flight upset, the flight crew were alerted by a passenger that another passenger had been injured. The SIC exited the cockpit to check on the passenger and to provide medical attention for a short period of time. He subsequently informed the PIC that there was a medical emergency and that they needed to land.   The flight crew informed air traffic control of the medical event and began a diversion to BDL. The PIC did not reengage the autopilot for the remainder of the flight. After landing, the airplane taxied to the ramp where an ambulance was waiting. Paramedics entered the airplane and subsequently transported the injured passenger to a nearby hospital. The passenger succumbed to her injuries later in the day at the hospital.  The flight crew reported that they did not experience any remarkable turbulence during the flight, nor during the time immediately surrounding the in-flight upset event.  According to preliminary data recovered from the airplane’s flight data recorder (FDR), the airplane during the first takeoff attempt reached a maximum airspeed of 104 kts displayed on the left PFD airspeed indicator and 2 knots on the right PFD airspeed indicator before the abort was initiated. No significant difference in airspeed was observed in the data for the remainder of flight, following the SIC’s removal of the pitot probe cover. Throughout the initial climb, multiple pilot commanded manual pitch trim inputs and corresponding movements from the horizontal stabilizer were observed.  During the climb, the preliminary FDR data showed that the autopilot had been engaged and disengaged three separate instances. With each autopilot engagement, an immediate master caution was annunciated (Note, the FDR does not record specific EICAS caution messages). The autopilot disconnected in the first two instances after the manual pilot pitch trim was activated and small pitch oscillations were observed after the disengagement. The autopilot was reengaged for the final time at 6,230 ft msl and remained on until reaching 22,780 ft msl. The airplane’s airspeed had increased from 238 knots to 274 knots in this segment of the climb.  Immediately preceding the in-flight upset event, the autopilot abnormal disconnect parameter was activated, and no manual pitch trim inputs were recorded. This data was consistent with flight crew’s report that the stabilizer trim switch was moved from ‘PRI’ (Primary) to ‘OFF’, which resulted in the autopilot disengaging.  The airplane immediately pitched up to about 11° and reached a vertical acceleration of about +3.8g. The airplane subsequently entered a negative vertical acceleration to about -2.3g. The airplane pitched up again to about 20° and a vertical acceleration of +4.2g was recorded. The stall protection stick pusher activated during this pitch up; subsequently, vertical acceleration lowered to about +2.2g which was followed by a cutout of FDR data. The FDR and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) were equipped with an impact switch g switch. The CVR continued to record for an additional 10 minutes as it was equipped with a back-up power supply, however, the CVR also stop recording data prior to landing at BDL.  A representative with Executive Flight Services (EFS) LLC., reported that they managed the accident airplane and employed the flight crew. EFS reported that the flight was operated as a non-revenue Part 91 flight operated by the owner of the airplane Conexon LLC.  According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airman records, the PIC held an airline transport pilot certificate and held a PIC type rating in the accident airplane, in addition to other type ratings held. EFS reported that the PIC had accumulated 5,061 total flight hours, and 88 hours in the accident make and model airplane. The SIC held an airline transport pilot certificate and held a PIC type rating in the accident airplane, in addition to other type ratings held. EFS reported that the SIC had accumulated 8,025 total flight hours, and 78 hours in the accident make and model airplane. In October 2022, both pilots completed initial ground and simulator training and earned their PIC type rating in the Challenger 300.  The airplane was retained for further examination and the CVR was retained for read-out and transcription."

On the second approach, the airplane was again high and fast, and touched down about 600 to 800 feet beyond the runway threshold. The runway surface was compacted snow and ice, and the braking action was poor. The airplane collided with a snow berm at the end of the runway, and received substantial damage to the landing gear and fuselage. The flight instructor did not take control of the airplane at any time before or during the accident sequence.  Probable Cause: The flight instructor's lack of action to correct a high and fast landing approach which resulted in a long landing, and subsequent collision with a snow berm at the end of the runway. Contributing to the accident was the student pilot's improper approach."

Thereafter, the instructor attempted to perform a recovery.  According to the instructor, initially both he and his student were simultaneously attempting to take corrective action and the student \"had too strong a grip on the throttle for me to overcome.\"  The instructor was handling the controls as the rotorcraft approached and contacted the ground.  The instructor stated that despite his efforts, the helicopter touched down hard.  No mechanical malfunctions were experienced during the flight.

He said the student was performing an off airport landing where the elevation was 4,500 feet mean sea level (msl); the density altitude was reported to be 7,300 feet msl.  The flight instructor said that as the helicopter approached the landing site, it began to yaw right, and the left pedal was ineffective.  He took control of the aircraft, and noticed that the main rotor RPM was low.  He lowered the collective slightly and rolled on additional throttle.  The flight instructor said that the left pedal would still not turn the helicopter into the wind.  He lowered the collective again, allowed the helicopter to settle, and then pulled collective to cushion the landing.  The main rotor contacted the terrain and mesquite shrub.  The aircraft came to rest on its left side, facing the direction from which it came, and the tail boom was separated from the fuselage.  Probable Cause: The student pilot's failure to maintain rotor RPM during landing approach, and the delayed remedial action by the flight instructor.  A contributing factor was the high density altitude weather condition."

        "details": "On March 1, 1994, at approximately 1850 central standard time, a Riley modified Cessna P337H, N2QY, was destroyed when it collided with the ground near North Little Rock, Arkansas. The airplane, owned and flown by an instrument rated commercial pilot, was on a business cross country flight. An instrument flight rules flight plan had been filed and cancelled and dark night visual meteorological conditions prevailed. The pilot, the sole occupant, received fatal injuries. The pilot departed West Lafayette, Indiana, approximately 1620 central standard time on an IFR flight plan to Little Rock, Arkansas. At 1834, Little Rock Approach Control cleared the flight for an ILS approach to runway 4L at the Little Rock Adams Field airport. At 1838, the pilot advised the tower that he was VFR and stated he would like to cancel his flight plan and proceed VFR to his private strip, which was about 17 miles north of the airport. The tower granted the request and gave an advisory that the restricted areas north of the airport were not active. The tower then handed off the flight back to approach control. At 1842, the pilot requested and received a frequency change so he could activate the lighting at his air strip. At 1846, the pilot returned to the approach control frequency and advised that he had the strip in sight. Radar service was terminated at that time.  According to the pilot's son, who was waiting for him at the air strip, it was his father's habit to file IFR and then cancel and fly to the strip. The son stated that the pilot had called him prior to his departure from West Lafayette, and advised of his estimated time of arrival. As a result, the son was able to monitor the progress of the approach and the pilot's decision to cancel and proceed to the strip over a hand held radio. The son stated that at that point, he drove to the south end of the strip to check for deer. He then positioned his vehicle at mid-field where he waited for his father's arrival. The son further stated that at approximately 1845, the runway lights were activated and he proceeded to the south end of the runway and positioned his vehicle so that the headlights shined on the threshold. He then contacted the pilot over the hand held radio and advised him as to the status of the runway, which he said was \"sloppy.\" The son then saw the airplane approaching from the northwest, flying southeast, as was the pilot's normal approach path. He observed both landing lights on. The pilot then advised that he had lost his instrument lights and the son advised him to reset the circuit breaker and of its position. The pilot advised he had regained the instrument lights and asked \"how do I look.\" The son advised that the airplane appeared to be \"a little high.\" The son stated that at that point the airplane turned south, approximately paralleling the runway on the east side, on a right downwind. The son said that the pilot then stated that he was going to start his base turn. The son further revealed that at that point the airplane pitched nose down to what appeared to him to be a 45 degree nose down attitude. He attempted to contact the pilot and said \"What are you doing down there? You're too low. Pull up, pull up.\" He related that the airplane appeared to begin a pull up as he lost sight of it behind a ridge which was located south of the runway. He subsequently saw a bright flash.  Probable Caus: \"Failure of the pilot to maintain control of the aircraft, while maneuvering to land. Factors related to the accident were: darkness and possible spatial disorientation.\""

The airplane sat in the field unattended over the weekend.  The pilot and one of the school's mechanics assessed the damage; none was found.  The pilot planned to transport the airplane back to the airport.  He put in fuel and performed a preflight and control check with no noted discrepancies. The pilot and the mechanic then moved the airplane to a rough dirt road; the pilot measured the available takeoff distance about 1,500 feet.  He reported that the takeoff and initial climb out seemed normal, but the airplane then started turning left.  The pilot applied right rudder and aileron but was not able to stop the turn.  His airspeed was in the 50-knot range, but about 35 to 40 feet agl, the airplane began to settle while still in an 18- to 20-degree left bank.  The stall warning indicator did not activate at any time.  The left wing tip impacted the ground, followed by the nose of the airplane.  The airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted.  The pilot stated that the winds alternated from calm to light and variable at 1 to 2 knots at the time of the accident.  A postcrash examination revealed that the flaps, ailerons, and rudders operated normally.  No mechanical discrepancies were found with any airframe or engine system.   Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to attain and maintain an adequate airspeed during takeoff from a short and unimproved dirt road, which resulted in an inadvertent stall/mush condition and impact with the ground."

The pilots elected to perform an emergency landing at another airportdue to its larger runways and emergency personnel and equipment. The airplane landed and came to rest upright on the runway surface. Examination of the airplane after landing revealed that the right main wheel/tire and lower shock absorberassembly departed the upper shock absorber assembly. The separated assembly, which was located near the departure airport, impacted the right horizontal stabilizer after separation, which sustained substantial damage.  Metallurgical examination of the assembly revealed that the MLG fractured at the connection between the upper and lower torque knees. Fatigue was identified on a fractured piece of the upper torque knee, and other fractures on the torque knee were consistent with overload. Corrosion assisted in crack initiation, and the crack propagated through fatigue until a critical crack length was reached. It is likely that the fatigue area fractured first and the other connections experienced an increase in loading, which caused them to separate from the MLG assembly.  Probable Cause: The fatigue failure of the right main landing gear upper torque knee."

        "details": "A Beech 200, N996LM, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. The two pilots and six passengers were not injured. The airplane was taxiing for departure at Mount Pleasant Regional-Faison field, SC (KLRO). According to the pilot, on his right side he observed a fuel truck that was parked on the right side of the apron, less than 20 ft from the center line taxiway marking for ramp guidance. He assessed that he had enough room to depart the parking area. No safety markings or cones were around the fuel truck, and no marshaling assistance or warnings were provided by the fixed-base-operator.The pilot also noticed a small single-engine airplane to his immediate left, pulling into a parking area adjacent to his airplane. He hesitated and 'shallowed out' his sharp left turn to avoid any contact with the single-engine airplane; however, the right-wing tip of his airplane contacted the fuel truck, which resulted in the outboard 2-ft of the wingtip shearing off at the rivet line. In addition, the outboard attach point of the aileron was sheared, and the aileron was damaged."

The pilot attempted to turn the airplane away from the hangars but the left wing dropped and the airplane collided with the ground. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the forward fuselage, and both wings. The pilot reported that the winds were calm, and there were no mechanical anomalies with the airplane's engine or flight control systems.

The private pilot was seriously injured.  The personal 14 CFR Part 91 flight was operating in visual meteorological conditions.  No flight plan was on file.  The flight departed a private airstrip called Shenandoah, Paragon, Indiana, exact time unknown.  According to the pilot's written statement, he only remembers planning a leisurely flight with a fueling stop at Bloomington, Indiana.  A broadcast interview at the hospital conducted by the TV station WISH out of Indianapolis, Indiana revealed the pilot making the following statement, \"I made a mistake I guess.  I had, I was in a steep bank and a lot of turbulence and got a little bit of negative g's out there and lost fuel pressure (the pilot used his right hand to show the airplane was in a 90 degree bank angle) and I was too low to the trees.\"  A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Inspector represented the NTSB during the on-scene investigation.  The FAA Inspector stated the airplane was performing aerobatic maneuvers over a valley where a \"Hog Roast\" party was in progress.  The owner of the property, where the airplane came to rest, saw the airplane performing aerobatic maneuvers over the valley prior to the mishap.  The airplane was low on the last maneuver and subsequently collided with trees and came to rest in a rock quarry.  The land owner stated that \"...I saw the accident aircraft flying in a scary manner.  Aircraft did a loop... .\"  \"Aircraft appeared to be wing high all the way to tree impact to the ground.  Aircraft appeared to not be in control.\"   Post-crash examination of the wreckage revealed the propeller did not remain attached to the engine and exhibited s-bending, twisting and chordwise scratching.  All flight control surfaces were accounted for.  All control cables were identified.  There were no pre-mishap discrepancies found with either the engine or the airframe.  The Pilot Operating Handbook (POH) states,\"No aerobatic maneuvers are approved except those listed:  Chandelles, Lazy Eights, Steep Turns, Spins and Stalls.\"  The POH flight load factor limits for this airplane are with flaps up: +4.4g, -1.76g's. PROBABLE CAUSE:the pilot did not maintain aircraft control.  The factors involved were aerobatics were performed and improper use of aircraft."

The en route part of the flight was uneventful.The flight crew established radio contact with Düsseldorf Radar at 05:43. The crew were told that runway 23L was in use. Two minutes later the radar controller contacted flight 8995: \"I just talked to the tower and ah for the time being braking action on all parts of the runway is supposed to be good. They are measuring again right now because it started to snow again and I'll keep you advised.\" The flight was then cleared to descend to FL80. The flight crew decided to set the autobrakes for landing on Medium, to account for the snow.At 05:50 the radar controller again contacted the flight about the current weather circumstances: \"...latest update on the weather situation ahm the friction tester has reported braking action to be good for the moment however as its continuing to snow they are ah afraid that it might worsen, so they are going to do another friction test right before you land.\"In the following minutes the flight was given descent instructions and vectors for an approach to runway 23L.At 05:54 the controller radioed: \"weather update we now have a surface wind of three four zero degrees eleven knots, that's slight tail wind component by two knots. Visibility is down to one thousand five hundred meters, still in snow showers and ah cloud base is now five hundred feet only.\"The flight was subsequently cleared for the approach.At 05:57 the radar controller instructed the crew to contact Düsseldorf Tower. The Tower controller stated: \"Good morning,... we are just waiting for the braking action values from the friction tester stand by a second. The surface wind is actually three three zero degrees one two knots.\"Two minutes later the controller radioed: \"... the braking action was measured to be medium at all parts. And ah the visibility dropped right now due to the heavy snow showers at the field ah. The RVR value at the touch down zone is presently nine hundred meters, at the mid-point one thousand one hundred meters and ah stop end one thousand one hundred meters.\" At that moment the flight was 3,5 nautical miles out. The flight was subsequently cleared to land.The airplane touched down about 1700 ft (518 m) past the runway threshold. Ground spoilers and thrust reversers deployed and the autobrakes activated. Still the airplane did not decelerate as expected and the pilot applied manual braking. The airplane failed to stop and overran the runway end. It collided with ILS aerials, which caused a fire in engines no. 2 and no. 3.The aircraft was withdrawn from use at Düsseldorf until being scrapped there in April 2006."

        "details": "On the morning of January 11th 2018 rain showers were present, the temperature was around freezing point and the runway braking action was poor at Reykjavik Airport (BIRK). It was decided to sand both runways. At 10:04 the controller contacted the flight crew of a Cessna 525A CitationJet CJ2, N525FF, and informed them of the braking action on runway 19. The flight crew decided to proceed and were cleared to \"Hold short RWY 19.\" This was read back correctly by the flight crew. At 10:07 the Tower controller gave the flight crew of N525FF the following instructions: \"525FF Backtrack line up RWY 19,\" which was also read back correctly by the flight crew. Following communications in Icelandic about the sanding of the runways, the controller cleared the flight \"... right turn line up RWY 19.\" The sanding truck had finished its run down the right side of runway 13. It then turned around at the end of runway 13 to start its run down the left side of runway 13, to sand that side of the runway. While the Tower controller was focused on communications he did not notice that the flight crew of airplane N525FF started their takeoff roll on RWY 19 after having turned at the runway end. When the sanding truck that was sanding runway 13 was about to cross runway 19, its driver noticed an airplane very close on runway 19, on his right side, just about to lift off. According to the sanding truck driver, he did not have sufficient time to react. The sanding truck was already at the runway center line of runway 19 when N525FF reached the runway section where RWY 19 crosses RWY 13. N525FF took off and flew over the sanding truck at 10:11. There was a serious risk of collision, as the minimum distance between N525FF and the sanding truck is believed to have been less than 1 meter.   According to the Pilot Flying (PF) of N525FF, he recalled that they had been cleared to taxi and backtrack runway 19. When they turned around to line up on runway 19, the PF also recalled that the PNF transmitted that they were \"ready for departure\". At this time the PF had already increased the thrust significantly and the aircraft started to slide on the ice, so the commander (PF) said \"we have to go\" and commenced the take-off. The ITSB analysis of the ATC recordings concluded that said transmission by the PF “ready for departure”, did not take place. The ITSB believes that if all the communications on the tower frequency would have been in English, then the flight crew of airplane N525FF might have been aware that RWY 13 was being sanded"

The airplane was destroyed, and the certificated private pilot was fatally injured. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight that had departed about 2035. No flight plan had been filed for the flight, which was destined for Wings Field, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.  The airplane departed at night after maintenance was performed on the left engine.  The pilot attempted to return to the airport and while on base leg struck the ground inverted and nose down.  The left engine propeller was found feathered.  On the left engine, the # 5 cylinder was off the engine and the # 5 piston with the connecting rod still attached were found nearby.  Interviews revealed that during maintenance, the # 1,3,5,and 6 cylinders had been removed and reinstalled; however, the # 5 cylinder had not been tightened.  Several people had worked on the airplane at various stages of the work.  The maintenance facility did not have a system to pass down what had been accomplished, and the FAA did not require the tracking of work accomplished in other than 14 CFR Part 121, or 14 CFR Part 145 facilities.   Probable Cause: The failure of the pilot to maintain airspeed during a precautionary landing which resulted in a loss of control while operating with one engine shutdown. An additional cause was the improper maintenance procedures that resulted in the #5 cylinder not being tightened down. A factor was the night conditions."

The airport manager stated that he noticed that the cockpit canopy was unlatched during the takeoff roll. He then contacted the pilot by radio. The pilot responded, but his transmission was unreadable. The aircraft made a left turn back to the runway. While making the final turn to align with runway 21 the airplane rolled to the right in a steep decent and impacted the runway.  Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to maintain flying speed during an emergency landing which lead to an inadvertent stall/spin. A factor was the pilot's failure to secure the cockpit canopy prior to takeoff."

        "details": "While practicing touch-and-go landings on his second supervised solo, the student pilot lost control of the airplane and veered off the left side of the runway.  He had been compensating for a crosswind estimated by himself and his instructor to be around 10 knots, and from the left side of the runway, 21R.  This compensation was accomplished using a forward slip, with the left wing down into the wind and right rudder.  In the past his instructor had noted problems with the student's execution of forward slips, and attributes the accident to the student not maintaining adequate wind correction.  At the time of the accident, winds at the airport were from 250 degrees at 13, gusting to 18 knots.  Measurements from in the hours preceding the accident and hours after the accident show differing angles of crosswind direction but similar speeds and gusts.  The airplane's performance charts indicate that a 13-knot crosswind would have been experienced under such conditions, and states that maximum demonstrated crosswind to be 15 knots.  The Chief Flight Instructor stated that he would solo a student in a maximum of \"7 to 10 knots of crosswind,\" but only if the student had been performing exceptionally well.  The school's curriculum sets no crosswind limits for students on their initial supervised solo flights.    Probable Cause: The student pilot's inadequate compensation for the wind conditions and failure to maintain directional control.  Also causal was the flight instructor's inadequate supervision of the flight in allowing the student to perform a solo flight with a strong, gusting crosswind near the factory demonstrated crosswind component limit.  Factors to the accident were the gusty crosswind conditions, and a lack of flight school standards pertaining to student pilot supervised solo flights in challenging weather conditions."

He reported that, during that pass, the airplane’s tail struck “unseen powerlines.” He recalled that the power lines crossed the field at an angle and that the power line poles were hidden by trees on both sides of the field. The pilot flew to a nearby airport and landed without further incident. The vertical stabilizer and the rudder sustained substantial damage. Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137.19 (e) states, in part, Knowledge and skill tests. The applicant must show, or have the person who is designated as the chief supervisor of agricultural aircraft operations for him show, that he has satisfactory knowledge and skill regarding agricultural aircraft operations, as described in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section.  (1)(i) Steps to be taken before starting operations, including survey of the area to be worked. … (1)(vi) Safe flight and application procedures. During an interview with the operator, the investigator-in-charge (IIC) asked if documented training was provided to pilots regarding the location of wire hazards for the area of operation, and the operator responded that it did not provide this information to its pilots. At the request of the IIC, the operator agreed to provide documented, local area power line and obstacle avoidance training to pilots who perform application operations. The operator has completed the recommended training. The pilot reported that there were no mechanical failures or anomalies with the airframe or engine that would have prevented normal operation.   Probable Cause: The pilot’s failure to adequately survey the area of operation and his subsequent failure to maintain clearance from power lines during an agricultural application flight."

        "details": "The flight instructor on the controls of the high skid-equipped-landing-gear helicopter reported that he was the pilot-in-command (PIC). The PIC reported that he and another flight instructor were performing simulated emergency procedures during the flight. He reported that he attempted to demonstrate a simulated fixed-pitch (right stuck antitorque pedal) emergency procedure. He reported that, during the maneuver, the nose of the helicopter was about 40° nose right of centerline. He reduced the throttle, and the nose corrected to about 20° nose right of centerline. The helicopter touched down on taxiway delta with minimal forward airspeed, and it then bounced about 5 ft above the ground and yawed right about 1 3/4 turns.The helicopter touched down a second time about 65 ft south of the taxiway centerline and rolled onto its left side. The helicopter sustained substantial damage to the firewall, main rotor drive system, and tail rotor drive system.  A METAR at the time of the accident reported that the wind was from 110° at 08 kts. The flight instructor seated in the right seat reported that the wind at the time of the accident was from 090° at 08 kts.  When the PIC was asked by the National Transportation Safety Board investigator-in-charge if he placed the collective in the full-down position after touchdown or if he increased the collective after the initial touchdown, he responded that he could not remember. When asked if he applied full left pedal to combat the right yaw, he said that he did not because the event happened quickly. According to the Federal Aviation Administration Helicopter Flying Handbook (FAA-8083-21A), the Helicopter Instructor’s Flying Handbook (FAA-8083-4), and Advisory Circular (AC) 90-95 “Unanticipated Rapid Right Yaw in Helicopters,” the loss of tail rotor effectiveness is a critical, low-speed aerodynamic flight characteristic that can result in an uncommanded rapid yaw rate that does not subside of its own accord and, if not corrected, can result in the loss of aircraft control. AC 90-95, Section 7.d.3. (page 7), defines flight characteristics and wind azimuths and states that the tail rotor vortex ring state occurs when the wind is from 210° to 330°. Winds within this region will result in the development of the vortex ring state of the tail rotor. AC 90-95, Section 10, “Recommended Recovery Techniques,” (page 8), states:  a. If a sudden unanticipated right yaw occurs, the pilot should perform the following: (1) Apply full left pedal. Simultaneously, move cyclic forward to increase speed. If altitude permits, reduce power. (2) As recovery is effected, adjust controls for normal forward flight. b. Collective pitch reduction will aid in arresting the yaw rate but may cause an increase in the rate of descent. Any large, rapid increase in collective to prevent ground or obstacle contact may further increase the yaw rate and decrease rotor rpm. The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the helicopter that would have precluded normal operation.   Probable Cause: The pilot-in-command’s delayed remedial action to arrest the right yaw after the bounced landing while operating in a flight regime conducive to the loss of tail rotor effectiveness, which resulted in a roll-over."

The pilot spent several hours at the Grand Canyon during which time he fueled the airplane. The pilot departed the Grand Canyon airport at about 1500 hours. A short time later witnesses observed a fire on the cliffs on the south side of a plateau. A pilot in the area afterwards reported the weather was clear and very turbulent with southwest winds to 20 or 25 knots. The pilot said it was impossible to get close to the wreckage because of the winds and turbulence. SAR personnel reported that the aircraft collided with a sheer cliff wall in a near level flight attitude about 200 feet below the top of the plateau. A fire consumed the aircraft.  CAUSE: the pilot's selection of an inadequate cruise altitude.  A factor in the accident was the high winds and turbulence in the vicinity of the cliffs."

        "details": "The pilot reported that, immediately after touchdown, the airplane began “wavering” and moments later veered to the left. He attempted to regain directional control with the application of “full right rudder” and the airplane subsequently departed the right side of the runway. A witness reported that the airplane’s touchdown was “firm” but not abnormal. As the airplane approached the left side of the runway, it yawed right and skidded down the runway while facing right. As the airplane began moving to the right side of the runway, the witness heard the right engine increase to near full power. The airplane spun to the left, coming to rest facing the opposite direction from its approach to landing. Another witness reported seeing the propellers contact the ground. The pilot attributed the loss of directional control to a main landing gear malfunction.  Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the left propeller assembly was feathered and that the right propeller blades were bent forward, indicative of the right engine impacting terrain under high power. Both throttle levers were found in the aft/closed position, and both propeller control levers were in the full-forward position. The propeller control levers exhibited little friction and could be moved with pressure from one finger. The evidence suggested that the pilot inadvertently feathered the left propeller assembly during the accident sequence. The pilot did not report any preaccident malfunctions or failures with the airplane’s engines or propeller assemblies that would have precluded normal operation.   Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane during the landing roll."

        "details": "The pilot was conducting a personal cross-country flight when there was a loss of engine power while in the traffic pattern at the destination airport. The pilot's attempts to restore engine power, including switching fuel tanks, were unsuccessful. The pilot heard the airplane's stall warning horn shortly before the airplane rolled right and entered an aerodynamic stall at a low altitude. The airplane impacted vegetation and terrain in a nose low attitude. The airplane came to rest inverted, with the fuselage suspended above the ground, against vegetation. The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the fuselage.   The pilot did not directly ascertain how many gallons of fuel were in the main fuel tanks before departure. The wingtip auxiliary fuel tanks were empty at departure. The pilot estimated that the flight departed with about 56 gallons of fuel available; however, based on available information, the investigation could not determine with an appreciable level of accuracy how many gallons of fuel was available before the flight and how it was distributed between the two 40-gallon (37 gallon usable) main fuel tanks.  The pilot stated that the flight departed with the fuel selector positioned on the left main fuel tank where it remained until the airplane lost engine power while in the traffic pattern at the destination airport. According to track data, about 2 hours of flight time had elapsed when the accident occurred. The pilot repositioned the fuel selector valve to the right main fuel tank after the loss of engine power, but that action did not restore engine power.  Postaccident examination revealed that the fuel selector valve was positioned to use fuel from the right main fuel tank. First responders to the accident site reported that there was fuel leaking from the damaged right wing. There was no evidence of fuel in the left main tank or the auxiliary wingtip fuel tanks. Additionally, there was no evidence of fuel in the lines connected at the fuel selector valve, in the fuel lines forward of the firewall, fuel strainer assembly, engine-driven fuel pump, fuel manifold valve, or the fuel injector lines. About ½ tablespoon of fuel was recovered from the fuel metering assembly. A disassembly of the engine-driven fuel pump confirmed the drive coupler remained intact. A postaccident engine examination did not reveal a mechanical failure that would have prevented normal operation; the loss of engine power was likely due to an interruption of fuel flow to the engine.  Based on available performance data for the cruise altitudes flown during the flight, the expected fuel consumption rate at 75% engine power is 13.5-15.2 gallons per hour (gph). However, the airplane was not equipped with an engine monitor or fuel flow meter with the ability to record how the engine was operated during the flight and, as such, the amount of fuel used during the flight could not be calculated with an appreciable level of accuracy.  Based on the available evidence, if the pilot switched to the fullest main fuel tank before landing, as required by the airplane's Before Landing Checklist, there likely would have been sufficient fuel remaining to safely land at the destination airport. The loss of engine power was likely due to fuel starvation resulting from the pilot's mismanagement of the fuel system.  Probable Cause: The pilot's mismanagement of the fuel system which resulted in fuel starvation and a total loss of engine power. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to maintain airspeed which resulted in the airplane exceeding its critical angle of attack and an aerodynamic stall at a low altitude."

After the practice run, he was unable to get a down and locked light on the left main undercarriage. Following several touch-and-go tests on Edwards Air Force Base 15000 foot runway, he determined that it was not safe to land. He successfully ejected, and N104RB crashed in the desert.  Note: There were two different Starfighters with the same registration, N104RB that has caused some confusion amongst aviation enthusiasts. The first aircraft, named the Red Baron, was a hybrid of parts from many F-104 aircraft assembled by Darryl Greenamyer and Ed Browning in order to reclaim the world altitude record, which had been set by a modified Russian Mig 25. This is the aircraft that crashed 26-Feb-1978. The second Starfighter registered as N104RB is CF-104D, Lockheed 583A-5302, previously operated by the CAF as 104632, the RNoAF as 4632 and is still flying with the Starfighters Inc."

        "details": "On February 21, 2005, at 1339 central standard time, a single-engine Bell 206-L1 helicopter, N5734M, operated by Air Evac Lifeteam was substantially damaged during a hard landing following a loss of control while hovering out of ground effect near Gentry, Arkansas. The commercial pilot, the flight nurse, and the paramedic were seriously injured and the patient was fatally injured. The helicopter was registered to Air Evac Leasing Corporation, of West Plains, Missouri, d/b/a Air Evac Lifeteam, and was destined for Springdale, Arkansas. No flight plan was filed and visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the air medical transport flight conducted under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135.  The purpose of the air medical flight was to pick up a patient who had been involved in a motor vehicle accident in a rural area, and to transport him to a hospital. The helicopter landed to the north on the front lawn of a private residence. After the patient was boarded, the commercial pilot attempted to determine the wind direction, but found no visual cues. However, he estimated the winds were about 10-15 knots from between 330 and 030 degrees. He stated that he had encountered similar winds while en route to the landing zone. A second EMS pilot who arrived at the scene after the accident stated that the winds were from 030 to 050 at 10 knots. The accident pilot stated that he brought the helicopter to a hover and maneuvered the helicopter to the right to avoid power lines that crossed the residential property. The pilot stated that when he departed, he began a vertical ascent but was trying not to increase the collective above the available torque. He stated that he was concerned about clearing the power lines and losing tail rotor effectiveness. When the helicopter reached an altitude abeam of the power lines, it began an uninitiated spin to the right. The pilot stated that the torque was near 100 percent. He applied full left torque pedal, and attempted to gain forward airspeed. He also used the cyclic to follow the nose of the aircraft in an attempt to fly out of the turn. The pilot was unable to gain airspeed and the helicopter continued to spin to the right and to descend. The pilot initiated an autorotation by lowering the collective and placing the throttle in the idle position, which he stated stopped the spinning. When the helicopter was about 10 to 20 feet above ground, the pilot placed the collective in the full-up position to cushion the landing. However, there was not sufficient main rotor rpm to stop the high rate of descent and the helicopter landed hard in a field adjacent to the private residence. Examination of the helicopter revealed no preimpact structural, system, or other mechanical anomalies. A critical wind azimuth in the Bell 206-L1 flight manual indicated an increased risk of loss of tail rotor effectiveness when winds are encountered between 050 and 210 degrees.  Probable Cause: The pilot’s improper decision to maneuver in an environment conducive to a loss of tail rotor effectiveness."

        "details": "On May 10, 1997, about 1303 eastern daylight time, an American AA-1, N5734L, was destroyed as it impacted the ground and collided with a fence during a forced landing south of the Greenbrier Valley Airport (LWB), Lewisburg, West Virginia.  The certificated airline transport pilot/owner was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions existed and no flight plan was filed for the personal cross country flight conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.  The flight originated from the Summit Airpark, Middletown, Delaware, about 1005.  The pilot was en route to San Antonio, Texas, with a planned stop at the Raleigh County Memorial Airport (BKW), Beckley, West Virginia.  He reported that due to the weather conditions, he changed his stop from BKW to LWB.  Thirty three miles from LWB, when the pilot contacted the tower controller for the weather, he stated that he checked the right wing tank and it was 1/2 full.  He reported that 23 miles from LWB, he checked the right tank again, and the fuel sight gauge indicated zero fuel.  The pilot stated that because of the weather and surrounding mountainous terrain, he requested a frequency for Washington Center to obtain an Instrument Flight Rules flight plan.  Upon contacting the Center, the pilot stated that he was not sure of the amount fuel onboard, and was fuel critical.  Shortly after notifying Center, the engine lost power and the pilot switched to the left tank.  The engine restarted, and he climbed to 5,000 feet.  Encountering weather, the pilot requested a lower altitude.  The engine lost power once again, and the pilot switched back to the right tank.  The engine operated for a few minutes, and then lost power again.  Unable to restart the engine, the pilot descended through instrument meteorological conditions to about 1,000 feet agl.  The pilot stated that he circled above a small pasture, and executed a forced landing.  On May 12, 1997, a Federal Aviation Administration Inspector conducted an examination of the wreckage and the impact area.  The Inspector reported that the airplane impacted on an upward sloping pasture, at an elevation of 2,410 feet mean sea level.  The airplane was heading about 050 degrees magnetic, when it impacted the terrain collapsing the left main and nose gears.  After traveling about 175 feet, the airplane struck a wooden post supporting a wire fence.  The airplane continued 200 feet further, coming to rest upright, on a reciprocal heading.  Inspection of the engine spark plugs, magnetos, timing gear section, throttle and mixture linkage, and electric fuel pump failed to uncover any anomalies.  No useable fuel was found in left fuel tank.  The right wing fuel cap was off, and not found in the wreckage area.  The Inspector reported that a small amount of fuel and about a quart of water was found in the right fuel tank.  He stated that it had rained between the time of the accident and his examination.  A photograph taken by the West Virginia State police within 2 hours of the accident, showed the right tank fuel cap missing.  The fuel cap had not been connected to a chain, and the owner stated that it attached by turning the cap a quarter of a turn.  The Inspector did not find any scarring or damage to the right fuel tank lip area.  The Airplane Owner's Manual indicated that the airplane's total fuel capacity was 24 gallons, with 22 gallons useable.  The Performance Charts indicated that between 2,500 feet and 4,500 feet, utilizing between 67 and 70 percent power, the endurance was 3.5 to 3.7 hours.  At the same altitudes and utilizing 75 and 77 percent power, the endurance was 3.1 to 3.3 hours.  The pilot stated that he checked the fuel caps during preflight and sighted them en route, but could not remember seeing the fuel cap after the fuel sight gauge indicated zero fuel. PROBABLE CAUSE:The pilot's inadequate preflight, which led to the loss of a fuel cap and subsequent fuel exhaustion."

        "details": "The pilot and his two passengers were in cruise flight over the Gulf of Mexico, when the pilot heard a \"pop\", and the single-engine helicopter suddenly pitched over and to the right. The pilot lowered the collective and stabilized the helicopter. The engine was running normally, but there was no response from the anti-torque pedals, and the pilot realized he had a possible tail rotor failure. He entered an autorotation and made a controlled landing on the top of a swell. As the helicopter settled, the pilot noticed that the center emergency float on the right side did not inflate and the helicopter rolled to the right. The pilot did not have time to activate the emergency life raft switch and exited the helicopter once it was fully inverted. While still under water, he inflated his life vest and immediately rose to the surface where he observed the two passengers. The three of them then held onto the skids of the helicopter and waited for a nearby boat to rescue them.  While waiting for the boat, the pilot did a quick check of the helicopter and saw there was no damage to the underside of the tail boom.  During the rescue, a tug boat arrived on the scene and attempted to secure the helicopter with ropes and drag it to a nearby barge. It was during this attempt in rough seas that the tail boom and the aft portion of the left skid along with the attached aft float separated from the helicopter and were not recovered. The main body of the helicopter including the main rotor system and the engine were recovered. A postaccident examination of the float system revealed that the flexible hoses that supply Helium to the mid and aft floats on both the left and right skids were installed incorrectly (interchanged) which resulted in non-restricted air being delivered to the mid float and restricted air being delivered to the aft float.  As a result, the right side center float burst due to excessive pressure and the aft float did not fully inflate.  Probable Cause: A suspected failure of the tail rotor for undetermined reasons. A contributing factor was the failure of the emergency floats to properly inflate due to improper installment and inspection by maintenance personnel."

At the top of the loop, while inverted, the airplane started the descent; however, the airplane was too low to recover. The airplane collided with the water in a nose-down, left-wing-low attitude. There was no noticeable change in engine noise during the accident sequence. Examination of the airframe, flight controls, engine assembly and accessories revealed no anomalies.  According to the pilot’s wife, for the 4 days leading up to the accident, the pilot had symptoms of a cold and was prescribed Amoxicillin, an antibiotic which treats infections.On the day of the accident, the pilot did not complain of or was not known to have any issues with light headedness or dizziness. Based on this information the pilot did not appear to have a medical condition that would have contributed to the accident and witness accounts indicated the pilot was maneuvering the airplane until impact with the water.   According to the operating rules section of 14 Code of Federal Regustions Part 91, which defines the restrictions on aerobatics, no person may operate an aircraft in aerobatic flight below an altitude of 1,500 feet above the surface. Probable Cause: The pilot's decision to conduct aerobatic flight at a low altitude, which resulted in a collision with the water."

The pilot noted no mechanical malfunctions with the airplane prior to the accident.  A preceding airplane in the pattern had advised the control tower of encountering a 10-knot tailwind.  The pilot said he heard this broadcast. Probable Cause: the pilot misjudged the airplane's distance/speed which resulted in an overrun.  A contributing factor was the tailwind."

As the aircraft was landing on runway 24R at Toronto, the south tower controller cleared ENY3702, an Embraer ERJ-145LR aircraft (N681AE) operated by Envoy Air from Toronto to New York-LaGuardia, NY, to taxi to position on runway 24R behind the landing traffic. Once ENY3702 was in position at the threshold of runway 24R, the south tower controller issued departure instructions that included an altitude and heading once airborne; however, the instructions did not include a takeoff clearance. As the Learjet was approaching the taxiway C4 high speed exit, ENY3702 was observed starting its takeoff roll on runway 24R without a clearance. The south tower controller issued an ABORT instruction to ENY3702 when the aircraft was at a speed of approximately 65 knots. ENY3702 rejected the takeoff and exited at taxiway D5.  The C4 exit is located about 2100 m from the runway 24R threshold."

About 300 feet agl, the engine lost partial power.  With partial power remaining, the pilot attempted a left turn back toward the airport; however, the engine continued to lose power.  The pilot subsequently performed a forced landing to a road.  During the landing, the airplane struck a vehicle and a berm, before coming to rest.  Witnesses reported that five or less minutes elapsed from the time of engine start-up to takeoff.  Review of the airplane owner's manual revealed information about the possibility of a rough engine in cold weather, and the recommendation to lengthen the warm-up and run-up times.  Examination and a successful test run of the engine did not reveal any pre-impact mechanical malfunctions.  Probable Cause: The pilot's improper decision to attempt a takeoff without allowing the engine to adequately warm-up; which resulted in a partial loss of power during takeoff and subsequent forced landing."

        "details": "The banner tow airplane departed, circled, and returned to the airport for the banner pickup. The operator said he was using a handheld radio and was prepared to provide flightpath adjustments to the pilot for the banner pickup, but the approach was “perfect” and the pickup was successful. He announced over the radio that the banner was captured and “looked good,” but the airplane then climbed at a much shallower angle than anticipated and drifted left of the runway heading. The airplane subsequently collided with a treetop, rolled inverted, and impacted the ground in a nose-down attitude. The owner of the property where the airplane came to rest was in her yard facing the runway when her attention was drawn to the sound of the airplane as it approached; the engine sounded normal and was smooth and continuous until impact. She stated that the airplane was in a level attitude when it struck the treetop, rolled inverted, and struck the ground nose first.  Detailed examinations of the airframe and powerplant revealed no preimpact mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. The throttle and mixture controls were in the full-forward position, the propeller control was three-fourths forward, and the carburetor heat control was in the “on” position. Assuming these as-found positions were the same at takeoff, the engine and propeller would have provided less-than-full power and thrust.  A review of the pilot’s logbook revealed he had accrued 333.1 total hours of flight experience, of which 26 hours were in the accident airplane make and model. In the 30 days before the accident, the pilot had had flown 1.8 hours, none of which was in the accident airplane make and model. According to FAA Advisory Circular AC-61-23C, Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge: “The effect of torque increases in direct proportion to engine power, airspeed, and airplane attitude…. During takeoffs and climbs, when the effect of torque is most pronounced, the pilot must apply sufficient right rudder pressure to counteract the left-turning tendency and maintain a straight takeoff path.” It is likely that the pilot did not apply enough right rudder to counteract the left-turning tendency of the airplane during climb.  Probable Cause: The pilot’s failure to maintain directional control during initial climb following a banner pick-up, resulting in collision with a tree."

The initial flare and touchdown were smooth at 85 knots. The airplane then floated and bounced twice, the nose gear collapsed, and the airplane came to rest about halfway down the runway. An examination of the airplane showed that the nose gear was separated from the airplane, resulting in substantial damage to the engine firewall. The pilot reported that he should have slowed to about 70 to 75 knots for touchdown to avoid floating and the subsequent bounced landing. The pilot stated that he was a corporate jet pilot and that he flew light reciprocating-engine aircraft only a few times a year. His perspective was that in flying corporate jets, computations of final approach speeds are more precisely determined and executed by the pilot. Final approach speeds in the light airplane category are determined moreso by an airspeed range depending on the wind conditions and gross weight. He offered that his higher-than-optimal approach speed was a result of not having recent experience in flying light airplanes. He stated that he had not flown a light aircraft for 6 months prior to this event.  Probable Cause: The pilot's excessive touchdown speed, which resulted in a bounced landing. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's lack of recent experience in flying light airplanes."

        "details": "The airplane collided with two deer shortly after touchdown at Troy Municipal Airport, AL (TOI). Following the collision, the airplane continued down the runway with the tires smoking, veered off the right side of the runway near the end, crossed a taxiway, impacted into a ditch and burst into flames. After the accident, the captain and first officer both reported that the thrust reversers failed to operate after they were deployed during the landing.Examination of the landing gear found all three gear collapsed. The right and left main tires had areas of rubber that were worn completely through. The flaps were found extended, and both thrust reversers were found in the stowed position. Examination of the cockpit found the throttles in the idle position, and the thrust reverser levers in the stowed position.Aircraft performance calculations indicate that the airplane traveled 1,500 feet down the runway after touchdown, in 4.2 seconds, before striking the deer. The calculations also indicate that the airplane landed with a ground speed of 124 knots. At 124 knots and maximum braking applied, the airplane should have come to a complete stop in about 850 feet. However, investigation of the accident site and surrounding area revealed heavy black skid marks beginning at the first taxiway turnoff about 1,500 feet down the 5,010 foot runway. The skid marks continued for about 2,500 feet, departed the right side of the runway and proceeded an additional 500 feet over grass and dirt.The investigation revealed that deer fur was found lodged in the squat switch on the left main landing gear, likely rendering the squat switch inoperative after the impact with the deer, and prior to the airplanes loss of control on the runway. Since a valid signal from the squat switch is required for thrust reverser deployment, the loss of this signal forced the thrust reversers to stow. At this point, the electronic engine control (EEC) likely switched to the forward thrust schedule and engine power increased to near takeoff power, which led to the airplane to continue down the runway, and off of it."

The airplane then suddenly lost about 3500 feet in altitude, accelerated to about 220 knots, and reversed direction within a 10 second period. Moments later, the airplane was observed traveling in a northwesterly direction at a low altitude, almost completely upside down at one point, with pieces of the airplane falling to the ground. Recorded radar data revealed that the airplane had entered a steep descending and accelerating left turn, and portions of the empennage separated from the airplane. The airplane continued on a descending, turning flight path until it impacted terrain. A postimpact fire ensued. The wreckage path was about ½-mile long and contained three distinct areas of debris. The first area contained the lower half of the rudder. The second area contained the vertical stabilizer, the rudder balance weight, the left horizontal stabilizer, the left elevator, the left wingtip, the left elevator balance weight, and the cockpit canopy—all of which had separated from their mounting locations. The third area contained the main wreckage (the fuselage, engine, and wings), which struck the top of a tree, fell to the ground, and came to rest inverted. Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of an inflight fire, explosion, flight control failure, bird strike, or any preexisting structural anomaly. Review of the airplane’s design revealed that at an aerobatic gross weight of 1,600 pounds, the airplane complied with the  6/-3G standards of the FAA’s aerobatic category. It had a maximum maneuvering speed of 124 knots and a never exceed speed of 200 knots. At the time of the inflight breakup, the airplane was traveling 20 knots above the published never exceed speed. A friend of the pilot noted that he had seen the pilot recover after falling out of a maneuver at low altitude before, and that it was not uncommon for the pilot to sometimes fall out of a maneuver (loop and/or roll). Review of a video taken by his friend revealed that, during that flight, the pilot performed a left roll. During that maneuver, the pilot allowed the nose to drop and the airplane lost approximately 1,000 feet of altitude. The accident airplane’s abrupt and sudden maneuvering, which exceeded its design limitations, is consistent with the pilot’s loss of control after attempting an aerobatic maneuver.   Probable Cause: The pilot's improper aerobatic maneuver that resulted in a loss of control, exceedance of the airplane's design limitations, and a subsequent in-flight breakup of the airplane."

The airplane reportedly had one of its two engines replaced and the pilot was to fly for about 4 hours to break-in the engine. The airplane did not return from the flight and was reported overdue. The airplane is missing and is presumed to have crashed. The airline transport pilot has not been located. The airplane was registered to Family Celebrations LLC, and was operated as a 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed. The flight departed SGS with the intention of returning to SGS at the conclusion of the flight.  The airline transport-rated pilot departed in the twin-engine airplane for a maintenance flight to break in a new engine. The flight was expected to last about 4 hours. Radar track data indicated that the airplane departed the airport and proceeded north following the western shoreline of a lake. While following the shoreline, the airplane descended from about 2,800 to 1,600 ft, which was its last recorded position. When the airplane did not return on time, it was reported missing, and an extensive search was conducted. However, the airplane and pilot were not found.  Probable Cause: Undetermined because the airplane was not found."

It was about 3000 ft in elevation and was snow covered most of the year, as on the day of the accident. The strip accommodated takeoffs to the south only due to grading and obstructions. Frequently, this meant a downwind takeoff. On the day of the accident, there was a 5 kt wind from the north with gusts to 10 kts. The pilot said that nose wheel steering was not effective due to the surface and the rudder was not responsive due to the tailwind. Most pilots used a 25 degree (right turn) dogleg of the runway at the north end to start their takeoff, especially when tailwinds were present. The accident aircraft went off the runway to the left and collided with a snowbank where it nosed over."

        "details": "The pilot receiving instruction performed several takeoffs and landings with a flight instructor aboard. The flight instructor then disembarked and told the pilot to perform three additional solo takeoffs and landings (to a full stop), which the instructor observed from the ground. According to the flight instructor, the pilot’s first flight around the airport traffic pattern appeared normal and terminated in a full stop landing and taxi back to the runway for the next takeoff. The instructor stated that the airplane appeared to touch down normally during the second landing; however, shortly thereafter the engine power increased and the airplane began to ascend. The airplane then climbed at a steep angle, entered an aerodynamic stall, and impacted terrain to the left of the runway.  Review of data recorded by an onboard recoverable data module showed that as the airplane approached the runway during the landing, the stall warning activated and 1 second later the pilot increased engine power. As the engine power increased, the airplane began an unarrested turn to the left and the pilot retracted the airplane’s flaps from the fully extended to the fully retracted position, which was contrary to the airframe manufacturer's published procedure for a balked landing. The data showed that after it reached an altitude of about 75 feet above ground level, the airplane entered an aerodynamic stall, and then rolled left while pitching down. The data recording ended before the airplane impacted terrain.  Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. The installed whole airframe parachute system likely deployed during the postimpact fire; however, given the low altitude at which the aerodynamic stall occurred, it is unlikely that preimpact deployment of the system would have positively affected the outcome of the accident.  Review of the pilot’s flight logs showed that he had accumulated more than 330 total hours of flight experience, including more than 220 hours in the accident airplane; however, he had not previously flown the accident airplane solo before the accident flight. Review of autopsy and toxicology test results showed no evidence of any preexisting condition that would have been expected to result in the pilot’s incapacitation. Probable Cause: The pilot’s failure to maintain control of the airplane during the aborted landing, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and impact with terrain."

The pilot stated that he noticed the airplane was too high while he crossed-over the approach end of the runway and that the \"airspeed was at stall [speed].\"  The pilot stated he responded by lowering the aircraft's nose and increasing engine power.  The pilot reported the increase of engine power \"did not respond until nearly on the runway.\"  The pilot stated the airplane \"landed hard\" and the main landing gear collapsed.   Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to maintain proper airspeed during final approach, which resulted in the inadvertent stall/mush at a low altitude and subsequent hard landing.  A factor to the accident was the pilot's unsuccessful remedial action to the encountered stall/mush at a low altitude."

        "details": "Pilgrim Flight 203 departed from Groton about 16:21, approximately 15 minutes behind schedule primarily because of ground delays encountered on previous flights which used the aircraft. Shortly after takeoff, Flight 203 reported on course and was instructed to contact the New York Center. Communications were established at 16:27 and the Center cleared the flight to Deer Park via its flight plan route to cross Saybrook at 4,000 feet, and then to climb and maintain 6,000 feet. At 16:33, the New York Center controller recleared the flight to Deer Park, to climb to 9,000 feet, and issued it holding instructions at Deer Park. About 2 minutes later, the controller advised that 7,000 feet was open for the flight, with the possibility of no holding, and he cleared it back to 7,000 feet. The flight reported at 7,000 immediately thereafter. About 16:36, the controller told Pilgrim 203 that if holding were necessary, its expected approach clearance time was 17.06. At 16:47 the crew contacted Kennedy Approach Control and they reported holding at Deer Park at 7,000 feet. About this time, the weather conditions at the Kennedy Airport deteriorated, and some flights which were then making instrument approaches to runway 13L began missing their approaches. Because of this, instrument approaches were changed to runway 22R, which had a better RVR. At 16:55, in connection with the runway change, Pilgrim 203 was recleared to hold in the Medford holding pattern. At 1709, Pilgrim 203 was given an expected approach clearance time of 17:46, which the flight acknowledged. At 17:39, the Kennedy approach controller cleared Pilgrim Flight 203 to descend to 6,000 feet. At 17:42, the crew of Pilgrim 203 radioed: \"Pilgrim 203 request New Haven if we can get there, expedite.\" At 17:48, the flight was cleared to descend to 4,000 feet, and at 1750, it was cleared to Pond Point, which is the final approach fix from which VOR instrument approaches are made to New Haven-Tweed Airport. During the next minute, Pilgrim Flight 203 contacted Westchester Approach Control and asked for the latest Tweed weather. It was advised that the weather was: Scattered clouds200 feet, estimated ceiling 500 feet broken, 700 feet overcast; visibility 2 miles, rain and fog; altimeter 29.46: wind variable 120deg to 040deg at 15 knots with gusts to 25 knots. At 17:53, the Westchester approach controller instructed Flight 203, \"Upon reaching Pond Point hold southwest on the 205 radial, right turns, EAC 1815.\" Two minutes later the controller checked the position of the flight and, finding it was suitable for descent, cleared the flight to descend to 3,000 feet. At 17:57, the flight reported at Pond Point and asked if holding were still necessary. The controller advised that it was and repeated the holding instruction. At 18:12, the Westchester approach controller called Flight 203 and advised that, based on a report from the Cessna pilot who just landed, the airport was below minimums. He advised the weather was: Aircraft ceiling 200 feet broken, 500 feet, overcast: visibility 2 miles. He then asked the pilot his intentions. About 18:13, after asking for and being given the Bridgeport weather, which was lower than New Haven, the flight advised it would make the approach. The flight was cleared for the approach and instructed to contact New Haven Tower. This was done, and, at 1814, the flight advised New Haven it was inbound from Pond Point. The controller acknowledged, cleared the flight to land, and repeated the surface wind as variable 120deg to 060deg, 15 knots with gusts to 25 knots. Shortly before 18:17, Flight 203 reported to New Haven it had missed its approach. The tower controller immediately cleared the flight to the Madison VOR at 2,000 feet and instructed it to contact Westchester Approach Control. At 18:17, the flight asked for the Groton weather. The controller then gave the flight the Groton weather as: Measured ceiling 300 feet overcast; visibility 1-1/2 miles, moderate rain and fog; wind 100deg at 15 knots, with gusts to 25 knots; altimeter 29.50. At 18:19, the crew told the controller, \"Westchester, wed like to ah get direct Groton right now.\" Within the same minute, the controller advised he was getting the clearance. The flight repeated that it had to get direct to Groton and the controller replied he had to coordinate (with New York Center). At 18:20, Flight 203 advised the Westchester controller, \"Ah Westchester, 203 ah we got minimum fuel now, we gotta get to Groton.\" About 18:21, the controller cleared the flight to the Groton VOR via Victor Airway 126 and climb and maintain 3,000 feet. The flight reported it was level at 3,000 feet and asked to be cleared for an approach to Groton direct from Saybrook. The controller advised the flight to contact Quonset Approach Control. At 18:22, Flight 203 called Bradley FSS and advised it could not contact Quonset Approach Control, it was low on fuel, and wanted clearance for an instrument approach direct to Groton from Saybrook. On request, Quonset Approach Control gave this clearance to Bradley FSS and, at 18:23, the latter delivered it to the flight. About 18:24, the captain of Flight 203 called his company radio and said, \"Were coming home with this... pile of junk. We aint got any equipment working.\" He then asked to talk to the chief pilot. The captain asked initially for the Groton weather which was ceiling 300 feet, overcast; visibility 1-1/2 miles, rain and fog Later, he was advised that the ceiling had lowered to 200 feet. The captain said that Kennedy would not accept him because the aircraft transponder was not working. He said he was inbound to Groton on the 270 degree radial of the Groton VOR, flying about 100 feet above the water, and he could see the shoreline. Asked how much fuel he had remaining, the captain answered \"none,\" and added, in essence, that fuel exhaustion could occur at anytime. Shortly thereafter, he radioed that he had lost one engine and was going to try to reach the shore. He then said he had just lost the other engine, could not make the shore, and was going into the water off Harkness Point. This was the last transmission from the aircraft."

As the airplane was being pushed back the flight crew heard and felt a few rough jolts from the nose wheel area. When the airplane stopped moving, the wing-walker gave the flight crew the emergency stop signal and the captain set the parking brake. The tug driver stated that during the pushback they did not notice anything unusual. The tug driver stated while towing the airplane forward and looking back to align the airplane with the taxiway, she heard the wing walker yell as the airplane rolled forward, and collide with the tug. The wing-walkers stated that it was raining as pushback procedure was initiated, and they noted a smell of glycol. The tug appeared to lose traction as the airplane moved passed the main landing gear chocks. The tug driver regained control of the tug, and continued the push back. As the tug operator began to tow the airplane forward, the wing-walker noticed that the airplane continued to roll forward when the tug stopped. The airplane collided with the tug and stopped with the tug on the right underside of the airplane. Examination of the airplane revealed that the hull of the airplane had a 5-foot tear on the underside of the belly. Further examination of the belly revealed two ribs and five stringers were damaged. Examination of the tow bar revealed the shear pin of the hitch head was sheered off. Metallurgical examination of the shank of the pin revealed that the pin was separated in two locations. Both fractures consisted of a flat surface displaying a small crescent shape with the remaining surface displaying a grainy texture. The features are typical of what is termed \"double shear\". Review of records showed that the tow bar was last inspected on September 21, 2005, and the shear pin was replaced on November 30, 2005.  \t\t   Probable Cause: The improper towing of the airplane by the tug operator which resulted in the shearing of the towbar shear pin and subsequent collision of the airplane and tug."

        "details": "After the replacement of an alternator belt that had failed on the previous flight, the pilot departed the airport; however, elected to return. While maneuvering in the traffic pattern about three minutes before the accident, the pilot, via his cellular phone, attempted to call the mechanic who replaced the alternator belt. A review of flight track data and witness information revealed that the airplane remained in the traffic pattern after taking off and that during the final approach, the airplane was at a low altitude and low airspeed. Witnesses observed the airplane stall and impact trees and terrain short of the runway.  Witness accounts and impact signatures to the forward fuselage were indicative of a nose-low, low energy impact consistent with an aerodynamic stall.   Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed the replaced alternator belt was displaced from the engine driven pulley and the alternator and was found lying near the back and bottom of the engine. Although this condition would affect the airplane’s electrical system, the displaced belt would not affect the engine power performance. No other mechanical malfunctions were noted with the airframe and engine that would have precluded normal operation.  Based on the autopsy findings and medical certification files, the pilot had several cardiovascular conditions that could result in sudden incapacitation; however, the operational findings did not suggest any sudden incapacitation or impairment. The pilot appeared to have made some good judgements about returning to the airport when he discovered an issue with his airplane. Thus, the pilot’s medical conditions and use of medications detected on toxicology testing were unlikely to have been factors in this accident.  Given the available information, it is likely the pilot was returning to the airport after an alternator malfunction. During the final approach to the runway, the pilot did not maintain control of the airplane, at an already low altitude, and the airplane impacted trees and terrain on short final approach.  Probable Cause: The pilot did not maintain a safe altitude during the visual approach, and subsequently lost control which resulted an impact with trees and terrain."

        "details": "On October 24, 2023, about 15:20 central daylight time, a Raytheon Hawker 850XP, N269AA, was taking off on runway 22 when its left wing collided with the vertical stabilizer of a Textron Aviation (Cessna) Citation Mustang, N510HM, that was landing on runway 13R at William P. Hobby Airport (HOU), Houston, Texas. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.   There were no injuries to the 2 pilots and 1 passenger aboard N269AA or to the 1 pilot and 3 passengers aboard N510HM. N269AA sustained minor damage and N510HM was substantially damaged during the collision. N269AA was operating as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 135 on-demand passenger flight from HOU to Waukesha County Airport (UES), Waukesha, Wisconsin. N510HM was operating as a Title 14 CFR Part 91 flight from Fulton County Executive Airport/Charlie Brown Field (FTY), Atlanta, Georgia, to HOU.  HOU has intersecting runways, and the local controller had instructed the crew of N269AA to line up and wait (LUAW) on runway 22. The crew of N269AA said in a post-accident interview that they believed they heard that they were cleared for takeoff when they took off. The collision between the two airplanes occurred at the intersection of the two runways,.  According to FAA record of communications, at 1514:12 the crew of N269AA had contacted ground control (GC) requesting clearance to taxi for departure.  About a minute later, the pilot of N510HM checked in with local control (LC) while on a ninemile final to runway 13R. The local controller then cleared the pilot of N510HM to land. The pilot of N510HM read back the landing clearance.  As N269AA approached runway 22 for departure, about 1515:50, ground control instructed the crew of N269AA to monitor LC frequency. The flight crew stated in their post-accident interview that as they passed taxiway “K2” during their taxi to runway 22 they switched to the LC frequency. As the airplane began the left turn to be perpendicular to the runway, they stated the V-speeds were no longer on the display screens.   At 1517:32 the pilot of N510HM reported a four-mile final.  At 1518:01 the local controller instructed the crew of N269AA to LUAW on runway 22, to which the crew acknowledged. The local controller did not give a traffic advisory to N269AA.  N269AA was in the takeoff roll on runway 22, when the flight data/clearance delivery controller alerted the local controller about N269AA’s movement, and at 1519:47 the local controller stated “november nine alpha alpha, stop, hold your position.” There was no response from the crew of N269AA, and at 1519:53 the local controller again stated, “alpha, alpha, hold your position, stop,” to which there was still no response.  The flight crew from N269AA stated in their post-accident interview they had a rudder bias alert, and a pitch trim alert which they had to resolve as they were in the takeoff roll.  Both crew members in N269AA said that they did not see the Citation Mustang until about 1 second prior to impact and described the feeling of the impact as a “thud.” The pilot in the left seat was the pilot flying (PF) and the pilot in the right seat was the pilot monitoring (PM).  At 1520:00, N269AA collided with N510HM. At 1520:14, the local controller began providing instructions to send around all aircraft that were on final approach behind N510HM.  At 1520:29 the crew of N269AA, who had taken off and was in the initial climb, informed local control that they needed to return to the airport, and the local controller provided vectors to return to the airport and land on runway 13R.  At 1521:08 The local controller cleared N269AA to land on runway 13R, and the flight landed otherwise uneventfully.  In the post-accident interview N510HM pilot said that he did not see N269AA airplane but heard a sound similar to a truck tire blowing out on a highway. N269AA crew stated that their airplane did not yaw, and they experienced no controllability issues during the takeoff. They were only aware of damage after parking and exiting the airplane  Airport Surface Detection Equipment:  HOU tower is equipped with an Airport Surface Detection Equipment – Model X (ASDE-X) system, with displays located at the LC, GC, operations supervisor, and helicopter position workstations.  ASDE-X is a surface movement radar that enables air traffic controllers to detect potential runway conflicts by providing detailed coverage of movement on runways and taxiways. ASDEX collects data from a variety of sources to track vehicles and aircraft on the airport movement area and obtain identification information from aircraft transponders.  The controllers noticed N269AA’s movement before the ASDE-X alert which occurred at 1519:49.  Aircraft Damage Assessment:  Post-accident examination of N269AA revealed that the left wing exhibited impact damage. The titanium leading-edge panel exhibited a “V-shape” aft indention to the wing front spar with sheet metal remnants of the Cessna Mustang embedded.  N269AA’s left-wing winglet remained attached to the left wing. The winglet leading edge exhibited white paint transfer marks and the navigation light lens was impact separated and pieces of the glass were found in the Cessna Mustang’s tail cone/stinger. About ten inches of the top section of N269AA’s winglet had separated due to the impact with N510HM.  Post-crash examination of N510HM revealed that the left side of its tail section had been impacted by the left wing of N269AA. The torn skin on the tail section was consistent with N269AA’s wing penetrating the left side of N510HM’s tail stinger and exiting the right side, severing a portion of the stinger.  The impact damage was isolated to the area of the empennage.  The impact fractured and separated a section of the aft canted bulkhead. A section of the aft horizontal stabilizer spar; common to the rudder sector attach point, was torn and bent consistent with the wing impact. The rudder sector mount was torn from the structure at the fastener locations.  The rudder torque tube was fracture separated from the rudder control sector and the rudder.  The upper and lower left and lower right rudder control cables were broken in a manner consistent with tensile overload.  The upper right rudder control cable remained intact, but the ball end was pulled from the rudder sector.  The autopilot rudder servo control cable was fractured in tensile overload.  The left autopilot cable pulley bracket, with pully attached, was separated from the canted bulkhead. The left strake was impact fractured from the tail cone stinger and was recovered from the runway along with various sheet metal fragments from the stinger  The following NTSB specialists have been assigned to investigate the accident: operations, human performance, air traffic control, and cockpit voice recorder (CVR). The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), National Air Traffic Controllers Union (NATCA), Textron Aviation, DuPage Aerospace Corporation (operator of N269AA), and My Jet DOM, LLC (operator of N510HM), are parties to the investigation.  N269AA was equipped with a CVR, which was removed and sent to the NTSB Vehicle Recorder Laboratory in Washington, DC, for download and analysis. N510HM was not equipped with recorders.  The investigation is continuing."

Shortly thereafter, the pilot felt a slight hesitation in the engine.  The pilot switched the fuel selector when the engine suddenly lost power.  The pilot initiated a forced landing on the remaining runway.  The aircraft touched down and the right main gear collapsed.  The right wing contacted the runway surface and the aircraft spun around coming to rest near the end of the runway.  Post-accident inspection of the engine found no evidence of a mechanical malfunction.  Both fuel tanks were inspected for fuel and a trace amount of fuel was found in each fuel bladder.  Inspection of the right wing inboard fuel sender found that the unit was unsecured.  The left wings sender unit was secured.  Both sender units were checked for cockpit indications.  Both indicated empty when the float was extended to the bottom of the tanks and indicated fuel levels throughout the movement of the float from top to bottom.  Approximately three gallons of fuel was put in the right side fuel tank to inspect for leaks.  None were detected.  The left wings piping structure had pulled out of the bladder connector during the accident sequence which allowed fuel to drain from the left fuel tank therefore fuel quantity could not be determined.  The left and right side fuel tanks are not interconnected.   Probable Cause: A loss of engine power due to fuel starvation during the initial climb after takeoff as a result of an unsecured fuel sender unit which resulted in a false fuel quantity indication."

        "details": "The pilot was landing at a large fly-in/airshow and following the airshow arrival procedures that were in use. While descending on the downwind leg for runway 27, the pilot was cleared by a controller to turn right onto the base leg abeam the runway numbers and to land on the green dot (located about 2,500 ft from the runway's displaced threshold). About the time the pilot turned onto the base leg, he observed an airplane taxi onto the runway and start its takeoff roll. The controller instructed the pilot to continue the approach and land on the orange dot (located about 1,000 ft from the runway's displaced threshold) instead of the green dot. The pilot reported that he considered performing a go-around but decided to continue the approach. As the pilot reduced power, the airplane entered a stall and impacted the runway in a right-wing-low, nose-down attitude. Witnesses estimated that the bank angle before impact was greater than 60 degrees. A postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.  Analysis of a video recording of the accident showed that the airplane was about 180 ft above ground level (agl) when the turn onto the base leg began, and it descended to about 140 ft agl during the turn. The airplane's total inertial speed (the calculated vector sums of the airplane's ground speeds and vertical speeds) decreased from 98 knots (kts) to 80 kts during the turn.  During the last 8 seconds of flight, the speed decreased below 70 kts, and the airplane descended from about 130 ft agl to ground impact. The wings-level stall speed of the airplane at maximum gross weight with landing gear and flaps down was 59 kts. In the same configuration at 60 degrees of bank, the stall speed was 86 kts and would have been higher at a bank angle greater than 60 degrees.   Reduced runway separation standards for airplanes were in effect due to the airshow. When the accident airplane reached the runway threshold, the minimum distance required by the standards between the arriving accident airplane and the departing airplane was 1,500 ft. The video analysis indicated that it was likely that a minimum of 1,500 ft of separation was maintained during the accident sequence.  Although the pilot was familiar with the procedures for flying into the airshow, the departing airplane and the modified landing clearance during a period of typically high workload likely interfered with the pilot's ability to adequately monitor his airspeed and altitude. As a result, the airplane entered an accelerated stall when the pilot turned the airplane at a steep bank angle and a low airspeed in an attempt to make the landing spot, which resulted in the airplane exceeding its critical angle of attack. At such a low altitude, recovery from the stall was not possible. Although the airshow arrival procedures stated that pilots have the option to go around if necessary, and the pilot considered going around, he instead continued the unstable landing approach and lost control of the airplane.    Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to perform a go-around after receiving a modified landing clearance and his failure to maintain adequate airspeed while maneuvering to land, which resulted in the airplane exceeding its critical angle of attack in a steep bank and entering an accelerated stall at a low altitude."

About 800 feet from the start of the takeoff roll the airplane became airborne about 8 feet off the ground, then went nose and left wing low into the runway where the left propeller struck the grass surface.  Twenty propeller slash marks were found in the grass surface at the point in the runway were the witnesses saw the propeller strike the ground.  The airplane then took off, climbed about 50 feet above the ground, turned left, struck trees, impacted the ground and caught fire.  According to a witnesses, the airplane had taxied to the takeoff point and the pilot did an engine run up.  At this point the witness said, '...[the] aircraft's engine seemed to sputter (one), he took off from the [north] end.  The aircraft took off, but didn't seem to climb.  The aircraft settled back down, propeller started hitting [the] ground, then aircraft got airborne again, made it over oak tree (note cross wind from pilot's right side).  Struck pine tree and [I] saw fire ball.'  Witnesses described the winds as gusty and a direct crosswind from the right side of the runway to the left side, with occasional shifts in the wind from the northwest.  The reported winds about 40 miles west of the crash site were: winds from 220 degrees at 14 knots.  Both engines were partially disassembled and no discrepancies were found.  Examination of runway 15 revealed 20 propeller slash marks were found on the left side of the runway, on a heading of 150 degrees, and were measured at a total distance of 453 feet, 3 inches. The distances between the first and second slash marks was 2 feet.  The distances between last two slash marks  was 61 feet.  It was determined that the ground speed of the airplane between the first slash mark and the second slash mark was 101.9 miles per hour.  CAUSE: the left engine propeller blades struck the runway surface during takeoff, resulting in the pilot losing control of the airplane, and subsequently impacting with trees."

        "details": "The private pilot was conducting a local personal flight. A witness located at the airport reported that he observed the accident airplane take off and then head southwest. He then observed the airplane perform a loop, and he estimated that, at the top of the maneuver, the airplane was about 1,500 ft above ground level.As the airplane began leveling off at the bottom of the loop, it descended out of the witness’s line of sight behind a building.The pilot reported that he did not recall anything about the flight. Postaccident examination of the recovered wreckage did not reveal any preexisting mechanical malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation. Wreckage and impact signatures were consistent with a high-energy, low-angle impact with terrain.It is likely that the pilot did not properly gauge the airplane’s distance from terrain while conducting the low-altitude aerobatic maneuver and failed to level off in time to avoid impacting terrain.  Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from terrain while conducting a low-altitude aerobatic maneuver."

One witness, located about 1 mile west of the airport, reported that the sound of the engine changed abruptly; noting that the engine seemed to lose power completely. Another witness, located near the airport, observed the airplane approach from the west and turn to align with the downwind runway. During the turn, the left wingtip struck the ground and the airplane impacted short of the runway, near Penny Royal Road. A post impact fire ensued. Although the pilot initiated a return to the airport, an interstate highway and an open grass area short of the runway were both potentially available for an emergency landing. A postaccident examination of the engine revealed that the No. 1 (aft) main crankshaft bearing failed due to unknown circumstances. The progressive failure of the bearing likely precipitated secondary failures of the crankcase through-bolt and the fuel pump coupling, which resulted in a complete loss of engine power. Probable Cause: The complete loss of engine power due to failure of the No. 1 main bearing, and the secondary failure of a crankcase through-bolt and the fuel pump drive coupling. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's decision to attempt a return to the airport for a downwind forced landing, despite having an interstate highway and an open grass area short of the runway as available emergency landing sites."

The pilot then took off from Wetumpka Municipal Airport and went to Autauga County Airport in Prattville, Alabama where he performed three touch and go landings and flew around the local area.  The pilot went back to Wetumpka and performed four touch and go landings.  From there, the pilot decided that he would fly to Auburn, Alabama.  While en route, the pilot stated that he \"fell asleep and ran the left fuel tank empty.\"  His next memory was the impact with the ground in a cotton field.  Examination of the airplane revealed the wreckage path was approximately 50 feet long on a heading of 210 degrees.   All three landing gears were separated from the airplane and both propeller blades were bent aft with no rotational twisting of the blades.  The engine mount was broken, the throttle control was found closed, the mixture was found full rich and the fuel selector was found on the left tank.  No fuel was found in the left fuel tank, however 10 to 15 gallons of fuel were found in the right fuel tank. Probable Cause: The pilot's mismanagement of the fuel supply, which resulted in fuel starvation and the subsequent loss of engine power.  A factor was pilot fatigue and the unauthorized use of the airplane ."

The passenger stated that she was concerned about how low the airplane was flying, but the pilot reassured her that they were fine and able to fly safely 200 ft above the water. The pilot then looked down at his tablet, which he was using for navigation, and the passenger saw him push the flight control yoke forward. The airplane descended and subsequently impacted the water and nosed over. The passenger was able to egress on her own as the airplane began to sink; however, the pilot appeared unconscious and did not exit the airplane.  Neither the wreckage nor the pilot's remains were recovered. Although the wreckage could not be examined, the passenger reported no mechanical problems with the airplane before the impact. It is likely that, as the pilot was looking down at his tablet, he inadvertently pushed the control yoke forward, causing the airplane to descend into the water. Because of his distraction in using his tablet to navigate, he failed to detect the descent.  Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from the water and his distraction by using the tablet for navigation, which resulted in his failure to detect that the airplane had entered a descent."

The business flight was operated under the provisions of Title 14 CFR Part 91 with an instrument flight plan filed. At the time of the accident the instrument flight plan had been canceled. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The airplane was destroyed, and the pilot and four passengers were fatally injured. The flight departed Hamilton, Ohio, at 1557.  The pilot and passengers were on a instrument flight returning home. When they were within range of the destination airport, the controller cleared the flight for an instrument approach. Moment later the pilot  canceled his instrument flight plan and told the controller that he was below the weather.  Low clouds, reduced visibility and fog existed at the destination airport at the time of the accident. The airplane collided with a river bank as the pilot maneuvered for the visual approach. The post-crash examination of the airplane failed to disclose a mechanical problem.  Probable Cause: The pilot continued visual flight into instrument weather conditions that resulted in the inflight collision with a river bank. Factors were reduced visibility and dark night."

        "details": "The airplane was in cruise flight at 4,000 feet when the pilot declared an emergency due to low engine oil pressure and requested radar vectors to the nearest airport. The pilot received radar vectors to fly direct to the nearest airport. Shortly thereafter, the pilot advised the air traffic controller that he was unable to reach the airport and was going to land in a field. According to a witness adjacent the field, the airplane flew at a low altitude over his home, and it made a sharp, banking turn in an attempt to land in the field. The airplane was unable to land in the clearing and collided with a tree line at the end of a field, and a postcrash fire ensued.   During the postaccident examination of the engine the left and right crankcase halves were found fractured between the No. 1 and No. 2 cylinder base pads. The No. 2 crankshaft journal was visible through the crankcase fracture, and no connecting rod was observed on the journal. Further examination of the No. 2 cylinder rod cap and the related bolt pieces revealed that the rod cap was fractured. Examination revealed that the bearing shells for the No. 3 and No. 4 cylinders displayed severe abrasive wear on the bearing surfaces. It is likely that due to the failure of the No. 2 rod end cap bolt, the rod end cap came loose, which resulted in a fracture of the case halves and subsequent loss of engine oil. After the loss of engine oil, the engine seized, which resulted in a total loss of engine power.   Probable Cause: The failure of the No. 2 rod end cap bolt, which resulted in a total loss of engine power."

The airplane encountered uneven terrain, and the landing gear sheared off. An inspection of the engine revealed that all spark plugs and the entire exhaust path were very sooty, which corresponded to rich operation. Examination of the fuel servo revealed that it had excessively worn throttle/mixture linkage arms and pins.  In addition, the mixture control linkage spring washer was missing.  This linkage section is vital to maintaining the correct flows at throttle open positions, and the play noted was excessive.  Probable Cause: The excessively worn throttle/mixture linkage arms and pins and a missing mixture control linkage spring washer, which resulted in a loss of power due to an excessively rich mixture."

        "details": "The pilot stated the taxi, takeoff roll, and rotation were normal. The pilot maintained runway heading until visual contact with the ground was lost, at which time a left turn to the assigned heading of 240 degrees was initiated. The pilot stated that while in the left turn, an  Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System warning of sink rate was received. A review of the instrument panel revealed a \"climbing left turn\" on the left instrument panel and a \"descending left turn\" on the right instrument panel. The pilot stated that he saw a red light and \"immediately pulled hard up\" at which time, the airplane struck a weather station antenna. The pilot added full power, leveled the wings and initiated a positive rate of climb, cross referencing both instrument panels until he was clear of the clouds. According to the FAA, the weather station antenna was located approximately 200 feet west of the departure runway, south of the Sierra taxiway, and west of the Romeo taxiway. The antenna measured 40 feet above ground level with a 4 foot lightening arrest rod attached at the top of the antenna. The FAA reported that the airplane impacted the antenna at a 30 foot level. The pilot and co pilot pitot instrument systems were removed from the airplane for bench testing. The test indicated that the systems did not leak and were in compliance with FAR 91.411. An examination of the remaining airplane systems, conducted by the FAA, revealed no anomalies. According to the aviation routine weather report taken at 1856, the weather was reported as visibility, 1/4 statute mile, freezing fog; sky condition, overcast 200 feet agl; temperature, minus 03 degrees Celsius (C), dewpoint, minus 04 degrees C.  Probable Cause: the pilot's failure to obtain/maintain a proper climb rate and the pilot's premature initiation of the turn (low altitude flight maneuver). Contributing factors include the pilot's improper in-flight planning and decision making, the low altitude, the fog,  and the weather antenna."

Along the route, the pilot encountered a heavy sink rate and no lift. He saw a field and proceeded to set up for a forced landing. During the approach phase, the pilot noticed some power lines perpendicular to the intended landing direction. He decided to put the glider on a base leg for a landing to the northeast, parallel to the power lines. As the pilot began the final approach, there was a sudden, dramatic increase in the sink rate, coupled with a decrease in the airspeed. In an attempt to gain energy to clear the rapidly approaching obstacles, the pilot put the nose down and tried to level out. Moments later, the left wing tip struck the top of a tree."

The ERJ-145 was on takeoff roll on runway 28R from intersection EE at ORD. The CRJ-700 (GJS3710) was taxiing to runway 28R via taxiways F and N.  GJS3710 did not turn left at taxiway N as instructed and instead entered runway 28R and made a left turn toward the departing ENY3084. According to the pilot of ENY3084, he maneuvered to avoid GJS3710, and continued his departure. ENY3084 was a regularly scheduled flight from ORD to Port Columbus International Airport (CMH), Columbus, Ohio. GJS3710 was a regularly scheduled flight from ORD to the Lester B. Pearson International Airport (YYZ), Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed.    Probable Cause:  The flight crew's  failure to manage cockpit tasks during  taxi resulting in a loss of situation awareness and  subsequently taxiing past a required turn point and onto an active runway without clearance. Contributing to the runway incursion was the ground controllers ineffective monitoring to ensure  issued taxi instructions were followed."

        "details": "The commercial helicopter pilot was operating on his first day of revenue service for the aerial tour company and was returning to the nontowered airport at the completion of a tour with six passengers. The pilot complied with the published arrival procedures, including flying the prescribed route and making the appropriate radio position callouts on the airport’s common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF). Concurrent with the helicopter’s arrival, the captain and first officer of an aerial tour airplane were beginning the taxi-out for departure of the positioning flight. The airport arrival procedures, layout, and wind conditions resulted in the two aircraft having to use the same portion of taxiway Delta, in the same direction, for their respective operations.  The helicopter pilot reported that he first saw the airplane when the helicopter was turning westbound and descending over Delta; at that time, the airplane was taxiing southbound on the ramp toward Delta. The helicopter pilot announced his location and intentions and continued descending along Delta. When the airplane reached Delta, the first officer announced on the CTAF that the airplane was planning to proceed westbound on Delta. The captain reported that he looked but did not see any helicopters and that he then proceeded to turn westbound onto Delta, which placed the airplane directly into and under the helicopter’s flightpath and prompted the helicopter pilot to radio that he was “right above” the airplane and repeat his landing intentions. The helicopter pilot continued the descent based on his hearing a “double-click” on the CTAF, which he interpreted as the airplane flight crew’s acknowledgement that they saw and would avoid the helicopter. Shortly thereafter, the helicopter collided with the airplane; damage patterns indicated that the two aircraft were aligned in nearly the same direction (westbound) at the time of impact.  Because the helicopter was approaching from the airplane’s left, along taxiway Delta, and was close in, it should have been readily visually detectable by the captain. Given that the first officer was aware of the inbound helicopter and should have been aware of its location and intentions based on the radio calls, the airplane’s flight crew should have recognized the high potential for conflict and operated the airplane in a manner to ensure that a collision would not occur. In addition, the helicopter, as the landing aircraft, had the right of way over the departing airplane. The simplest and most effective method to prevent any conflict would have been for the airplane flight crew to stop on the ramp and not proceed onto taxiway Delta until the helicopter was positively determined to no longer pose a collision threat. However, there was no evidence that the airplane stopped before it turned from the ramp onto taxiway Delta. The evidence indicated that the airplane taxied out just ahead of and below the descending but faster moving helicopter, which significantly reduced the helicopter pilot’s ability to avoid the airplane.  Probable Cause: The airplane flight crew’s failure to exercise the necessary vigilance and precautions and yield the right of way to the landing helicopter, which resulted in the airplane colliding with the helicopter. Contributing to the accident was the helicopter pilot’s decision to continue his descent without positively determining that the airplane did not pose a collision hazard."

According to the pilots, shortly after being cleared for landing on runway 3R, they performed the landing configuration and before landing checks and no abnormalities were observed; the landing gear position lights indicated three green and no red. A normal landing was made in the touchdown zone, but shortly after, during the rollout, there was a “violent” left yaw and directional control was lost. The pilot used full right rudder deflection and aileron to keep the airplane centered on the runway; simultaneously, the landing gear unsafe horn sounded. The red left landing gear light illuminated, and the left green light extinguished. The airplane came to rest about 3,800 ft down the runway with the left wing partially resting on grass adjacent to the runway. The left landing gear was collapsed, and the airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and flight control surfaces."

One witness reported observing and hearing the helicopter seconds prior to the mishap, and no unusual engine sounds were noted. Another witness reported hearing the helicopter collide with the power line(s). The witness reported that the helicopter then rolled upside down and fell.  The helicopter was destroyed and the commercial pilot, who possessed a flight instructor certificate, was fatally injured. The second pilot, who possessed a private pilot certificate (which had been issued on July 9, 1993) was also fatally injured. According to a relative of the private pilot, during the accident flight the private pilot had planned to receive dual flight instruction. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the mishap. The flight originated from Auburn, California, at an estimated time of 13:00 PDT.  Following the collision, a fire started on a hillside adjacent to the crash site. The fire burned an estimated 50 acres of native vegetation before it was extinguished.  According to the Placer County Sheriff, the helicopter crashed into the north fork of the American River. The helicopter came to rest in shallow water a few yards from the river's east shoreline. The tail boom assembly was found about 15 feet from the main wreckage. About 1/2 dozen electrical burn arc marks were noted on the main rotor blades.  The Federal Aviation Administrator's coordinator examined the accident site and helicopter wreckage on-scene. The coordinator verbally reported observing a power line on the helicopter's rotor mast. No evidence was found of pre-impact failures of the engine (Serial Number L-16229-39A), transmission, or rotors.  A spokesperson from the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG & E) reported that, as a result of the crash, a power outage occurred on the electric company's Middle Fork-Weimar 60kV lines at 1359. Electric power was restored to PG & E's 2,273 customers by 15:15 PDT.   The PG & E spokesperson further reported that the poles from which its 3 transmission lines (conductors) had been suspended were about 2,274 feet apart from each other. The conductors measured 3/8-inch in diameter, and were composed of aluminum wrapped around a solid steel core. The west and east bank poles #19/1 and #19/0 were each about 45 feet tall.   The vertical distance between the river and the impacted lines was estimated at 550 (plus or minus 50) feet. The collision occurred over the river (gorge) about midway between the poles. Neither the transmission lines, nor their supporting wood poles had been marked with devices designed to increase their conspicuousness."

        "details": "A single-engine public use helicopter was destroyed when it impacted water while maneuvering over a lake at night during a search mission.  The 2,475-hour commercial pilot reported that he had set the altimeter to the current barometric pressure setting of 29.75 inches of Mercury prior to departure.  Then, he and the pilot-rated passenger departed and made several passes over the lake at 500 feet, then descended to 300 feet for better visual reference of an object on the water.  The crew still had difficulty identifying the object and the pilot descended to 200 feet.  The pilot reported that there was absolutely no reference to the horizon, so he told the passenger that he would be \"on the instruments.\"  As the pilot made a right hand turn, he said the altimeter indicated a slow descent from 200 feet, so he pulled back slightly on the cyclic and increased collective pitch to start a smooth, climbing right turn.  As the pilot did so, the passenger shouted, \"look out!\"  The pilot pulled the cyclic back sharply and looked out the windscreen.  The pilot thought that he was about to strike a tower because the altimeter indicated an altitude between 150 and 175 feet.  The pilot then saw a \"black wall\" through the windscreen and they collided with the water.  Examination of the altimeter revealed that it was not impact damaged, but did exhibit water and corrosion damage.  It displayed a barometric pressure setting of 29.66 inches of Mercury and an altitude of approximately 110 feet.  Due to corrosion, the unit could not be bench tested.  The face of the instrument was removed, and excessive corrosion was observed inside the unit and around the gears.  The barrel shaft (turn knob) was locked, but it was engaged to the barrel.  The number-wheels were also intact and engaged.  According to the aircraft checklist, the altimeter was to be set and checked by the pilot prior to take-off. Probable Cause: **This probable cause was modified on 2/22/2016. Please see the public docket for this accident for additional details.**  The pilot's failure to maintain a safe altitude, resulting in collision with the water.  A factor was the dark night."

Therefore, the helicopter touched down on its belly, driving the external load hook up into the airframe bulkhead structure in the area of the left hand transverse fuel tank. After he realized what had happened, the instructor pilot took control of the aircraft, lifted it off of the runway, lowered the landing gear, and set it back down on the wheels. They then shut the aircraft down and inspected for damage. Probable Cause: The dual student's failure to extend the landing gear during a simulated single-engine forced landing, and the flight instructor's failure to take remedial action to keep the aircraft from touching the runway surface without the landing gear extended."

No one observed the airplane prior to the spin.  All of the witnesses, one of whom is a commercial pilot, heard the sound of the turbine engine running throughout the spin, which consisted of 3 or 4 complete rotations.  The purpose of the flight was to meet the specifications as outlined in the Phase 1 flight testing portion of the experimental operating limitations, as issued by the FAA.  This was the third recorded flight.  Due to the post-impact fire, control continuity was not confirmed during the subsequent wreckage examination.  No evidence of preexisting mechanical malfunctions was noted with either the engine or propeller assembly.  The engine and propeller control linkages were in the normal operating range near flight idle.  During engine disassembly and teardown, a composite material, similar to a heat shield material commonly used to insulate the composite cowling, was located in the compressor and burner sections of the engine.  The engine is a reverse flow free power turbine, with the power turbine shaft connected to the propeller.  The engine is mounted in the airframe with the compressor inlet at the rear of the engine compartment. Probable Cause: the pilot/builder's failure to maintain an adequate airspeed while maneuvering that resulted in an inadvertent stall/spin."

The pilot and two passengers were not injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 aerial observation flight.  The pilot reported that he was conducting a power pole inspection flight with an observer and another passenger. While about 250 ft above ground level (agl) and about 50 knots indicated airspeed, the engine experienced a total loss of power. The pilot entered an autorotation and turned right to an area suitable for a forced landing. During the descent he saw a set of power lines and increased the collective control to clear the power lines. He added that after he had passed over the powerlines, he felt a slight shudder. Subsequently, the helicopter touched down on slightly sloped terrain. The pilot and passengers exited unassisted.  The pilot recalled that just prior to the loss of engine power, it increased its speed uncommanded and the manifold pressure increased. He indicated that he may have seen the auxiliary fuel light flicker about 45 seconds prior to the engine losing power.  Postaccident examination revealed the lower vertical fin was crushed upwards and the tips of both tail rotor blades exhibited damage.  The helicopter was recovered to the operator’s hangar for further examination."

        "details": "The pilot reported that, while on approach to the runway, the vacuum pump failed, then the engine lost power. The pilot initiated a forced landing to a field, and the airplane impacted multiple metal poles. Postaccident examination of the engine revealed that the left magneto drive gear and the left idler gear shaft were separated from their mount. Both of the attachment bolts for the left idler gear shaft were separated from the crankcase, and their respective bolt bores were elongated. One of the attachment bolts for the left idler gear shaft was fractured, and metallurgical examination revealed that the fracture surface was consistent with fatigue. Metallurgical analysis determined that the fatigue was due to a lack of sufficient preload on the bolts. Maintenance records showed that the last logged maintenance activity in which the bolts could have been manipulated was performed about 20 years before the accident. The engine had accumulated about 1,400 operating hours since that time. Probable Cause: The loss of engine power due to the fatigue fracture of one attachment bolt for the left idler gear shaft, which resulted from an insufficient preload on both attachment bolts."

The airplane was in cruise at 5,500 feet when the pilot decided to do a practice emergency power off landing to an airport below him.  He set up for left traffic to runway 21.  The rpm was idling between 800-1,000 rpm and he was maintaining 85-88 knots air speed.  He set the flaps to 50 percent about 800 feet above ground level (agl).  The airplane was descending through 450 feet agl when he decided that he was too low to make the runway and he initiated a go-around.  He added power, and did not bring the flaps up.  He pulled the stick back and established a positive pitch up attitude.  He thought that the engine responded, but the airplane was still descending and it impacted terrain about 50 yards from the airport.  During a post accident examination, the engine ran successfully through the range of power settings from idle up to 2,600 rpm.  The engine ran for approximately 3 minutes.  Downloaded information from the Avidyne Engine Data Log indicated that during the last 6 seconds of recorded data, the rpm went from 1,200 to a maximum of 2,300, manifold pressure went from 8.8 to 21.4 inches, and fuel flow went from 1.9 to 19.2.  The recorded data did not show any anomalies in power development for the flight.  Probable Cause: the pilot's delay in executing a timely go-around and failure to raise the flaps, which resulted in a collision with terrain."

        "details": "During cruise flight on a dark night, the airplane collided with a mountain while diverting to an alternate airport due to a low fuel state.  According to the pilot, he fueled the airplane with 48 gallons of fuel and departed Cedar City, Utah, with full tanks.  He arrived at Elko 2 hours later, did a touch-and-go landing and takeoff, and then departed for the return trip to Cedar City.  His route of flight took him over the Ely, Nevada, airport, where he noted the fuel gauges were running low.  He made three unsuccessful attempts to activate the runway lights so that he could land and refuel the airplane.  When he was unable to activate the runway lights, he decided to continue the flight to his destination.  The pilot stated that when he was about 90 nautical miles beyond Ely he realized that his flight was taking longer than expected and one fuel gauge was showing less than 5 gallons and the other one was showing 5 gallons.  He contacted Salt Lake ARTCC and communicated his low fuel situation to the controller, who then vectored the pilot south towards an airport at Panaca, Nevada.  The pilot reported to the controller that one of the fuel tanks had run dry.  The controller then told him that a highway was directly underneath the pilot's location; however, the pilot could not identify the road due to the dark night conditions.  The controller then asked the pilot if he was able to climb for terrain clearance, to which the pilot replied negatively.  At that point, the controller instructed the pilot to turn to a heading of 180 degrees for terrain avoidance and the pilot was complying with the turn instructions when he simultaneously saw and crashed into the mountain.  According to the airplane manufacturer, the airplane's total fuel capacity is 50 gallons, of which 2 gallons (1 gallon each side) is unusable for flight.  According to the manufacturer, the airplane's typical fuel burn is about 10 gallons of fuel an hour.  The airplane had been airborne about 5 hours when the accident happened.  Probable Cause: controlled flight into mountainous terrain due to the pilot's inadequate preflight planning and preparation and his inadequate in-flight decisions, which created a low fuel state emergency situation that led directly to the CFIT during flight assist efforts by controllers."

He said that the edge of the ramp was not marked, and before he could complete a turn, the nosewheel departed the pavement. He attempted to taxi across the grass area to the parallel taxiway about 50 feet from the ramp. However, the airplane struck a drainage ditch located between the ramp and the taxiway, which caused substantial damage to the delta fins on the underside of the aft fuselage. The pilot said that there were no mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane. He said that the ramp was poorly illuminated and the high overcast clouds combined to create \"very dark\" lighting conditions.  Probable Cause: The pilot's decision to taxi the airplane across an unpaved area after the nosewheel inadvertently departed the ramp pavement."

The engine did not respond to the throttle input, and the propeller stopped.  About 3,000 feet from the runway, the airplane impacted trees.  The pilot had the left fuel tank selected and 18 gallons was found in the tank after the accident.   Post accident examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal a reason for the power loss.  After replacing the propeller, the engine was started and it operated normally, exhibiting normal pressures and acceleration.  Probable Cause: a loss of engine power for undetermined reasons."

Postaccident examination of the tail rotor components revealed that one of the tail rotor blades' root enclosures, along with its associated weights and attachment bolts, had separated. The other tail rotor blade sustained a 6-inch-long dent about mid-span when the root enclosure separated.   About 200 flight hours before the accident, the subject tail rotor blade was removed from service due to a delamination of the root enclosure at the root block and a repair was made of the blade's root enclosure area. Scratches were observed on the root block around the edge of one of the tail rotor blades' root enclosure areas, consistent with surface preparation for the repair. However, while the surface preparation with the scratches created an appropriate bonding surface, the adhesive did not properly bond to the remaining area of the faying surface due to corrosion.   Additionally, no adhesive was applied into the gap between the root enclosure and root block. This action would require the surface in that area to be prepped for the application of the adhesive, and no evidence of such preparation was observed. The surface of the root block to where the enclosure was bonded was corroded with paths of oxidation extending outboard, consistent with trapped moisture between the adhesive and the enclosure, which eventually resulted in the enclosure separating from the root block.   Probable Cause: The separation of one of the tail rotors blades' root enclosures due to improper repair."

EXAMINATION OF THE SITE REVEALED THE AIRCRAFT IMPACTED THE GROUND IN A STEEP NOSE DOWN ATTITUDE WHILE ROTATING TO THE RIGHT. SEARCH AND RESCUE HELICOPTER PILOTS RETURNING FROM ANOTHER AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT SITE FLEW NEAR THE LOCATION ABOUT ONE HOUR AFTER THE ACCIDENT. THE PILOTS REPORTED THAT THE TOPS OF THE MOUNTAINS WERE OBSCURED IN CLOUDS AND SNOW SHOWERS.  CAUSE: THE DECISION OF THE PILOT TO CONTINUE VFR FLIGHT INTO INSTRUMENT METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS, SPATIAL DISORIENTATION AND INADVERTENT STALL/SPIN. FACTORS WERE: OBSCURATION, LOW CEILING, AND OVER-CONFIDENCE IN ABILITY."

        "details": "On September 21, 2023, about 1436 eastern daylight time, an Embraer SA EMB-525, N434FX, operated by Flexjet LLC, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near St. Simons Island, Georgia. The pilot, copilot and six passengers were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91K fractional flight.  The flight departed Westchester County Airport (HPN), White Plains, New York at 1239, destined for St. Simons Island Airport (SSI), St. Simons Island, Georgia.  According to the pilot, the departure and en route phases of the flight were uneventful. During the arrival phase into SSI they elected to fly the RNAV (GPS) Runway 4 approach to allow them to be better aligned and setup for the landing. Checklists and callouts were conducted, and the approach was stable. After the 500 ft stable callout was made the airplane crossed over a small section of trees and rose slightly. The airplane then began to porpoise slightly when it was about 100 to 150 ft above mean sea level. The pilot tried to make corrections, but the airplane was not responding to his control inputs. The airplane then landed hard and slid along the runway, coming to rest in the grass off of runway 4. After the airplane came to rest, they evacuated the passengers safely and powered down the airplane.  According to the copilot, the flight from HPN to SSI was uneventful until the final few seconds. When they were cleared for the approach, the pilot configured the airplane, slowed appropriately, and selected “Flaps 3” for the landing. The checklists were completed, and they had the runway in sight when they were 10 miles from the airport. No other traffic was identified as being in the airport traffic pattern and they prepared to land.  The copilot made the “500’, Stabilized, 20 knot of headwind” callout at approximately 500 ft’. As the airplane crossed above the airport property, it began to pitch rapidly up and down.  The copilot then looked over at the pilot’s hand on the control side sick and he could see him moving it back and forth excessively. He then said something along the lines of “Take it easy there,” and the pilot replied that the airplane was not responding. At that point the airplane was “maybe 50 ft” above the runway.  The airplane touched down hard, prior to the runway threshold, on centerline, bounced and then touched down again. The airplane was listing to the right and skidding on the runway while slowly drifting to the right. The airplane slid off the runway and onto the grass where it hit a concrete sign base before it came to rest on the grass.  Prior to opening the main cabin door, the copilot realized that both engines were still running. He then asked the pilot to shut down engines so that he could open the door to deplane the passengers. The copilot observed fuel gushing from the belly of the airplane when he exited.  Examination of the accident site and airplane revealed that the airplane was substantially damaged. Both main landing gear were damaged, and the struts had punctured the top of the wings. During the impact sequence the airplane skidded down runway 4 for approximately 2,531 ft, then departed the right side of the runway, shearing off eight runway lights, one taxiway light, and destroying the taxiway A4 directional sign. The right main landing gear separated from the airplane and the leading edge of the right wing was damaged consistent with the impact with the taxiway sign. The airplane then went across taxiway A4, coming to rest between runway 4, taxiway A, and taxiway A4. The total distance from the airplane’s touchdown to where the airplane came to rest was approximately 3,083 ft.  The reported wind at SSI about the time of the accident was from 050° at 13 knots, gusting to 23 knots.  According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and pilot records, the pilot held an airline transport pilot certificate, with a rating for airplane multiengine land, and commercial privileges for airplane single engine land and single engine sea. He also held type ratings on the BE-300, BE-400, CE-560XL, CE-650, CL-600, EMB-550, HS-125, and MU-300. His most recent FAA firstclass medical certificate was issued on June 13, 2023. He reported that he had accrued approximately 10,900 total flight hours, with 1,872 hours in the airplane make and model.  According to FAA and pilot records, the copilot held an airline transport pilot certificate with a rating for airplane multiengine land, and commercial privileges for airplane single engine land. He also held type ratings on the A-310, A-320, B-757, B-767, DC-9, DC-10, EMB-550, and LR-JET. His most recent FAA first-class medical certificate was issued on June 13, 2023. He reported that he had accrued approximately 16,686 total flight hours, with 306 hours in the airplane make and model.  According to FAA and maintenance records, the airplane was manufactured in 2020. The airplane’s most recent continuous airworthiness inspection was completed on April 11, 2023, at 2,863 total hours of operation  The airplane was equipped with a cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, which were retained for read-out. The wreckage was retained for further examination."

        "details": "A Gulfstream 450 airplane encountered turbulence while in level cruise flight at 36,000 ft. and a cabin server (CS) fractured her arm and leg.  The flight crew reported that after departure, while climbing through 20,000 ft, they encountered unexpected light turbulence, and the seatbelt sign was illuminated. About 30 minutes into the flight at a cruising altitude of 36,000 ft (FL360) in visual meteorological conditions with the autopilot engaged, the copilot noticed a cloud top 'rising upâ from under the nose of the airplane.  The airplane 'pitched up and down rapidly with a hard jolt;â however, the autopilot did not disengage, and the airplane returned to normal flight. A passenger notified the flight crew of injuries to the CS.   At the time of the turbulence event, the CS was in the aft galley taking catering notes, when she felt a rising sensation. She attempted to get low to the floor in case turbulence was encountered. While looking over her shoulder to check on the passenger cabin, she was thrown into the air and 'hurledâ to the floor impacting on her left shoulder, arm, and hip. Upon being notified of the injury, the flight crew declared an emergency and diverted to Miami for medical assistance. The injured CS was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a fractured left arm and multiple fractures to her left leg.  At the time of the turbulence encounter there were no active convective significant meteorological information (SIGMETs), international SIGMETs, center weather advisories (CWAs) or pilot reports (PIREPs) for the area where the turbulence occurred.  Probable Cause: An unanticipated encounter with convective induced turbulence from developing cumulus clouds below the flight path, which produced strong updrafts and downdrafts."

As the airplane reached an altitude of 20-25 feet, the right control wheel broke off in the pilot's hands.  The pilot reduced the power to idle, the airplane rolled to the right, impacted a tree, and came to rest inverted on the ground.  Examination of the fracture surface on the shaft of the control wheel revealed features typical of an overstress separation.  No evidence of fatigue cracking or other type of preexisting cracking or deterioration was noted.  The upper portion of the fracture intersected the upper hole approximately at a 45-degree angle, indicative of torsional loading of the shaft (with the handle portion of the wheel turning to the left - counterclockwise) as the shaft fractured.  According to the pilot/owner and the pilot-rated passenger (seated in the left seat), the control lock had been installed in the control wheel, and was removed during the preflight.  Probable Cause: The overstress separation of the control yoke from the control column."

The pilot advised the air traffic controller before departure that he did not want to execute any instrument landing system (ILS) approaches even though they were in use at the time, and neither transceiver was configured to the localizer frequency. Due to the mountainous terrain surrounding the airport, local air traffic control (ATC) had designated certain mode 3 transponder codes that inhibit minimum safe altitude warning (MSAW) processing for a controller. This was accomplished to prevent repeated nuisance alarms for aircraft operating under visual flight rules (VFR) and not requesting MSAW processing. The pilot did not request MSAW monitoring before departure or at any time during the flight; therefore, the assigned VFR transponder code (0210) inhibited the MSAW. The pilot departed the flight with a reported ceiling of 1,500 feet and 10 miles visibility before proceeding south of the departure airport and electing to return, remaining in constant contact with ATC. While operating only several hundred feet above mountainous terrain, in instrument flight rules conditions due to fog, the pilot did not advise the controller of the weather encountered. While being vectored towards the airport, the airplane impacted trees then terrain at an elevation of approximately 2,809 feet mean sea level. The pilot made no distress call and the controller did not provide a MSAW warning to the pilot. Postaccident examination of the airplane, engine, and engine systems revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction. While testing of avionics revealed that the “Trim” light bulbs of the autopilot remote mode annunciator and the autopilot and flight director computer were illuminated at the moment of impact, the left pitch trim actuator was found in the neutral position and the circumstances of the accident do not support a pitch trim malfunction. Additionally, the autopilot was not activated at the moment of impact. Probable Cause: The pilot’s attempt to maintain visual flight during instrument meteorological conditions, resulting in controlled flight into mountainous terrain. Contributing to the accident was the pilot’s failure to advise the controller of the weather conditions encountered, and his failure to request minimum safe altitude warning (MSAW) monitoring before departure."

The pilot was cleared by the ATC Tower, for \"right traffic,\" and return for a landing on runway 9R.  On the second attempted landing witnesses saw the airplane touchdown past midfield and abort the landing.  The airplane stayed low to the ground just above the trees, made a left turn toward the north, and started descending behind the trees.  The airplane impacted with power lines about 100 feet above the ground and came to rest in the front yard of a private residence about 1 mile east of the airport.  There was no post crash fire nor was there any evidence found to indicate a fire in the engine assembly.  The examination of the engine assembly and the testing of the fuel pump, throttle/fuel metering unit, and the 6-fuel injector nozzles, revealed no discrepancies.  Probable Cause: the pilot-in-command delayed initiating a go-around and failed to obtain sufficient altitude to clear obstacles at the departure end of the airport which resulted in an in-flight collision with power lines."

        "details": "The helicopter was about 76 pounds under its maximum gross weight for the takeoff at a density altitude of about 6,800 feet. The pilot lifted the helicopter into a hover 2 feet above ground level (agl) and departed into the wind, which was variable from 210-260 degrees at 10 knots, gusting to 18 knots. After the helicopter entered translational lift, the pilot accelerated the helicopter to 30-35 knots and climbed to about 10-20 feet agl. The helicopter suddenly started to settle, the low rotor rpm warning light illuminated, and the warning horn sounded. The left seat passenger, who was a flight instructor, took control of the helicopter and attempted to recover rotor rpm. Unable to regain enough rotor rpm to maintain flight, he decided to land under control rather than continue to an uncontrolled crash. He was only able to slow the helicopter to about 15-20 knots before leveling the helicopter to land. The helicopter touched down in rough, uneven terrain, and substantial damage was incurred to the fuselage and tailboom. Examination of the helicopter did not show any evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have resulted in the loss of main rotor rpm and settling.   The pilot and the left seat passenger stated that they could have operated the helicopter at a lighter takeoff weight for greater performance or waited until early morning to depart when the cooler temperatures would have reduced the density altitude. Further, they stated that the wind gusts resulted in the loss of some of the headwind component. Additionally, the left seat passenger reported that at the time the helicopter began to settle, a freight train was crossing about 30 to 50 yards in front of the takeoff flight path of the helicopter. He stated that he believed the train probably blocked some of the headwind component as it passed. A reduction in the headwind component would have resulted in the helicopter settling at a critical point during the takeoff. The pilot and the left seat passenger stated that the collective was probably raised slightly to compensate for the settling, which caused the decay of main rotor rpm, and once that happened, the helicopter was in a position that was not recoverable.  Given that the settling was sudden during an otherwise routine takeoff, it is likely that a wind gust, the blocking of the wind by the passing train, or a combination of the two resulted in an abrupt decrease in headwind, which caused the helicopter to lose lift and descend. Because the helicopter was already operating near its maximum performance capability (high gross weight at high density altitude), there was not enough reserve power available to stop the descent and maintain rotor rpm.  Probable Cause: The sudden decrease in headwind during takeoff in a gusty wind and near a passing train, which resulted in a loss of lift and main rotor rpm. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's decision to operate the helicopter near its maximum performance capability (near gross weight at high density altitude), which resulted in a lack of reserve power available to compensate for the wind change."

Contributing to the accident was the pilot's decision to operate the helicopter near its maximum performance capability (near gross weight at high density altitude), which resulted in a lack of reserve power available to compensate for the wind change."

The flight crew reported that at an airspeed of approximately 110 knots, the nose of the airplane began to lift off. The captain attempted to lower the nose, however, the airplane was unresponsive. The airplane became airborne and climbed to an altitude of 20 to 30 feet above the runway. The captain reduced the power on both engines and the airplane settled to the runway, striking the tail. The airplane traveled approximately 700 feet off the end of the runway where it came to rest in the muddy terrain. An emergency evacuation was performed during which the L2 evacuation slide did not deploy. During the investigation, NTSB determined that the airplane was loaded so that its center of gravity (CG), although within limits, was in the aft region of the permissible range. Further, the flight crew had incorrectly set the trim for the trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS) at -1.7°UP (airplane nose up). This setting resulted in a pitch-up trim condition. The proper trim setting, 1.7°DN (airplane nose down), would have resulted in a correct trim condition for the way the airplane was loaded. The improperly set trim caused the nose of the airplane to lift off the runway prematurely."

        "details": "The helicopter landed hard following a loss of directional control during a precautionary landing after a hydraulic system failure, with the main rotor blades cutting off the tail boom.  This was a tour flight that was en route back to the departure airport when a complete hydraulic system failure occurred and the pilot decided to make a precautionary landing at a nearby airport.  He had planned on conducting a run-on landing; however, during the approach the airspeed dropped to 30 knots.  The helicopter's nose dropped and it started to spin to the left.  The pilot pulled back on the cyclic enough to get the nose up; however, forward airspeed continued to decay and the rotation rate increased.  The pilot said that the flight controls were not responding, and he believed the only way to stop or slow the rotation was to shutdown the engine.  The helicopter completed two revolutions before it impacted the ground in a nose level attitude, 180 degrees from its original direction of travel.  A witness to the accident reported the altitude of the helicopter as it began to spin was about 30-50 feet above the ground and he saw the main rotor blades cone upward as it fell to the ground.  For a hydraulics failure, Federal Aviation Administration approved flight manual required the pilot to reduce the collective pitch and adjust the airspeed between 40 to 60 knots in level flight.  The pilot was then instructed to cut off the hydraulic pressure by activating the collective lever pushbutton, and to make a flat approach over a clear landing area and land with forward speed.  During examination of the hydraulic pump, investigators noted that the coupling sleeve splines were worn beyond serviceable limits.  They also noted the general condition as rust colored, and no lubrication was found inside the pump housing or coupling sleeve splines.  A company maintenance work order contained a serviceable tag for the hydraulic pump assembly.  The serviceable tag that the operator's maintenance personnel wrote said that the hydraulic pump was \"inspected, cleaned filter, new O rings installed on connections, inspected coupling, new pump assembled.\"  The maintenance records also revealed that the assembled hydraulic pump was installed 15 days prior to the accident and had been in service for 74.6 hours when it failed.  A metallurgical examination of the hydraulic pump revealed that it had failed due to the wearing away of the splines on the coupling sleeves.  The wear was due to insufficient lubrication and soft splines on both coupling sleeves.  The failure mode was assisted by an increase in internal rotational resistance at operating temperatures.  The hardness testing indicated that the case hardened layer on the splines was not deep enough and the hardness, within the layer, was slightly below the specified range.  The inner surfaces of the gear bearings displayed rubbed areas, consistent with hard contact, and areas of bluing, consistent with elevated temperatures.  Examination of the coupling sleeves revealed a total loss of inwardly protruding spline material and hardness below the design requirements.  The manufacturer's maintenance manual requires that the pump drive shaft, coupling sleeves, and bearing be packed with \"abundant\" grease during assembly.  The examination found only a trace amount of grease in the coupling sleeves that did not satisfy the \"abundant\" requirement specified in the manufacturer's maintenance manual.  There was rust on the front retaining rings and bearings, which indicated that there was insufficient grease in the splines to retain it or lubricate the splines.  Probable Cause: the pilot's failure to maintain an adequate airspeed and main rotor rpm during the landing approach as prescribed in the hydraulic pump failure emergency procedures found in the rotorcraft flight manual, thus resulting in a loss of control of the aircraft and the subsequent crash.  Contributing to the accident was the failure of the hydraulic pump due to excessive coupling spline wear which was caused by the application of insufficient lubrication by the operator's maintenance personnel during pump installation and the improper manufacturing of the couple sleeve."

The aircraft also did not respond when back pressure was applied to the yoke. Subsequently, the first officer called out to abort the takeoff and the captain then pulled the power levers to idle, extended reverse thrusters and applied brakes. After the aircraft came to stop, pilot made a 180 turn on the runway to return to the ramp area and it was during this time that the first officer reported seeing smoke coming from the right side of the aircraft. The Captain then called for the evacuation of passengers by the first officer while he shut the engine down.

        "details": "The flight instructor and private pilot receiving instruction (pilot) initiated a practice autorotation from about 700 ft in the airport traffic pattern. As the helicopter reached about 150 ft, the instructor slightly opened the twist grip throttle to initiate a power recovery but realized shortly thereafter that the applied power was insufficient to arrest the helicopter's autorotative descent. The instructor applied additional power, and as the helicopter reached 40 ft, the pilot receiving instruction raised the collective, but the helicopter continued to descend in a flat attitude. The instructor then advanced the twist grip to full power but reported that the engine power did not increase as expected. The low rotor rpm horn activated, the nose yawed left, the helicopter rolled to the left, and the main rotor blades impacted the ground, resulting in substantial damage. A detailed examination of the collective control, twist-grip throttle, and governor control system revealed no pre-impact mechanical anomalies. It is likely that the flight instructor could not apply sufficient power to abort the practice autorotation following the pilot's collective input, which resulted in an unrecoverable low rotor rpm condition and subsequent loss of control.  The helicopter's flight manual stated that the lowest recommended height for aborting an autorotation was 300 ft; however, the instructor initiated the recovery at 150 ft, which resulted in reduced time and altitude available to recognize that the engine was not responding as expected and continue with a power-off, touchdown autorotation. In a service letter published after the accident, the manufacturer advised against initiating a power recovery from an autorotation in the flare, as it could result in a loss of yaw control upon application of maximum engine torque.   Probable Cause: The flight instructor's delayed application of power during a power recovery following an autorotation, which resulted in an unrecoverable low rotor rpm during the landing flare and subsequent loss of control."

        "details": "The pilot was maneuvering in the airport traffic pattern at the time of the accident.  The pilot entered a continuous right turn from downwind toward the final approach course when he abruptly lost control.  A witness stated that the airplane wings were \"totally vertical\" before it nosed over and descended toward the ground.  A second witness also reported that the airplane wings were nearly vertical before it descended below the tree line.  He added that the engine sounded \"fine.\"  An NTSB performance study revealed that after the airplane entered the airport traffic pattern, it began a continuous right turn from downwind toward the final approach course suggesting that the pilot did not fly a traditional rectangular traffic pattern, but instead flew a circling base to final pattern.  The airplane approached the extended runway centerline in a 48° right bank, at 103 kts and about 220 ft agl. Lateral accelerations began to increase shortly before the accident and varied between 0.37g and 0.62g for the final portion of the flight.  The lateral accelerations were consistent with sideslip angles of 15° to 20° during the final turn.  The calculated angle-of-attack (AOA) of the wing subsequently exceeded the critical AOA and the airplane entered a descent which ultimately reached 1,800 fpm.  Although the pilot's control inputs were not directly recorded, the large lateral accelerations are consistent with left rudder input and an uncoordinated flight condition for the airplane.  The accident site was located in a wooded area about 1/2 mile southeast from the landing runway threshold.  Airframe and engine examinations did not reveal evidence of any anomalies consistent with a preimpact failure or malfunction.  The Pilot's Operating Handbook noted that extreme care must be taken to avoid uncoordinated or accelerated control inputs when close to the stall, especially when close to the ground.  If, at the stall, the flight controls are misapplied and accelerated inputs are made to the elevator, rudder, and/or ailerons, an abrupt wing drop may be felt and a spiral or spin may be entered.  The FAA Airplane Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-3B) noted that coordinated flight is important to maintaining control of the airplane.  Situations can develop when a pilot is flying in uncoordinated flight and depending on the flight control deflections, may support pro-spin flight control inputs.  This is especially hazardous when operating at low altitudes, such as in the airport traffic pattern.  A cross-control stall occurs when the critical AOA is exceeded with aileron pressure applied in one direction and rudder pressure in the opposite direction, causing uncoordinated flight.  The aerodynamic effects of an uncoordinated, cross-control stall can occur with very little warning and can be deadly if it occurs close to the ground.  The nose may pitch down, the bank angle may suddenly change, and the airplane may continue to roll to an inverted position, which is usually the beginning of a spin.  Probable Cause: The pilot's uncoordinated flight control inputs and subsequent inadvertent cross-control aerodynamic stall in the airport traffic pattern that resulted in a loss of control and uncontrolled descent with insufficient altitude for recovery."

He added that he began a descent to the runway without observing the runway lights or airport and encountered “ground fog” about 200 to 300 ft above ground level (agl). He further added that he continued the descent to the runway while referencing the navigational moving map and GPS altitude on his electronic flight bag (EFB) application ForeFlight. Subsequently, while in a left turn, the airplane impacted terrain about 1 nautical mile south of the runway.  The left wing, firewall, and fuselage sustained substantial damage. The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. He added that, while en route, he reset his airplane-installed barometric pressure altimeter to the GPS altitude indicated on his EFB, which resulted in a “300 ft. error.”  An automated weather observing station, about 14 nautical miles west of the accident airport, recorded visibility at 2 1/2 statute miles, light rain, mist, and an overcast cloud ceiling at 300 ft agl.  Probable Cause: The pilot's decision to continue the night, visual flight into instrument meteorological conditions, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain while on final approach. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's improper use of an electronic flight bag."

The impact from the birdstrike resulted in contact between the fan and inlet case that separated all nineteen (19) fan blades. The released blade fragments penetrated the engine case and cowl and caused an engine fire. A blade fragment impacted the right wing and punctured the fuel tank resulting in fuel spillage onto the wing surface and runway. Materials analysis on recovered fan blade fragments determined that all separated blades failed due to overload and no evidence of fatigue was identified. A series of modal tests including: tap hammer, high energy shaker, and computer model simulation were conducted at the system and component level. The tests identified a four nodal diameter coincidence at about 72% N1 speed. When sufficient energy is imparted to the engine fan during a foreign object ingestion event like a birdstrike, it may result in a rub induced excitation and subsequent fan blade separation and catastrophic engine failure.   The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident as follows: The probable cause of the uncontained No. 2 engine failure on the Raytheon Beechjet 400A was a yellow-crowned night-heron birdstrike that resulted in fan blade contact with the inlet case and rub induced excitation of a previously unidentified natural frequency (resonance) within the engine operating range."

The pilot reported that before starting his takeoff roll he completed the predeparture checklist, and then he configured the wing flaps by placing the flap handle into the first notch. During the takeoff roll, and as the airplane achieved a takeoff speed, the pilot applied an additional notch of flaps. The pilot reported that as the airplane became airborne, the left wing contacted an area of overgrown brush, which briefly pivoted the airplane to the left. The pilot then applied full right rudder to correct for the pivoting and realign the airplane over the site, resulting in a reduction of airspeed. The airplane subsequently descended into an area of brush-covered terrain at the departure end of the site, sustaining substantial damage to the wings and fuselage. The pilot noted that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.   Probable Cause: The pilot's selection of an unsuitable takeoff area, resulting in an inflight collision with vegetation/brush during takeoff."

The pilot and pilot-rated passenger were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.  According to the pilot, he departed Brookhaven Airport (HWV), Shirley, New York, on the day of the accident for a local flight. About 20 minutes into the flight, at a cruise altitude of 3,500 ft mean sea level, he noticed the manifold pressure dropping. He pushed the throttle, mixture, and propeller controls full forward. The engine did not respond, and he looked for a place to land the airplane. He noticed that the ocean tide was low, so he decided to land on the beach. The airplane landed hard, the landing gear collapsed, and the left-wing spar was substantially damaged. The airplane veered left and came to rest in the water.  The wreckage was retained for further examination."

In his written statement to the NTSB, he  indicated he performed a cruise descent from 2,100 feet to 700 feet above mean sea level (msl) with the carburetor heat on.  After a short time at 700 feet he applied full power to gain altitude, and about 900 feet msl, the engine lost power.  He attempted to restart the engine without success.  During an emergency landing to a dirt road, the airplane collided with unmarked electrical wires, which redirected the airplane into the trees along the dirt road, resulting in structural damage to the wings and fuselage.  An examination of the airplane at the accident site by the NTSB revealed fuel in the carburetor and in the airplane's fuel tank.  During an operational test run of the airplane's engine, the engine was started and ran at various power settings.  The carburetor was removed and evaluated on a flow test stand.  No mechanical anomalies were found with the engine or carburetor.  Probable Cause: The total loss of engine power for an unknown reason while maneuvering, which precipitated an emergency descent and landing, and resulted in an in-flight collision with power lines and trees.  A factor associated with the accident was the power lines."

A deputy sheriff reported that a resident near the accident site found the airplane on August 13, 1996, at 1745 hours.    The pilot said in a telephone interview conducted on August 15, 1996, that he topped off the fuel tanks before departing William J. Fox Airport.  He said that the airplane would not clear the mountain pass near Rosamond due to the high density altitude.  After realizing that the airplane would not negotiate the mountain pass, he began to circle to gain additional altitude, but the airplane struck a tree.  The pilot said that the engine operated normally. PROBABLE CAUSE:The pilot's inadequate preflight planning and his delayed decision to reverse the airplane's direction."

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the local flight.  The airplane was destroyed.  The pilot and passenger both reported having received minor injuries.  The flight was to have originated at the time of the accident.  The pilot reported that prior to takeoff the winds were from 180 degrees so he elected to use runway 18 for departure.  He reported that one to two seconds after liftoff his airspeed decreased from 62 KIAS to 52 KIAS and the right wing dropped.  He stated he noted that the midfield windsock was now showing a 90 to 100 degrees shift in the wind direction.  He stated that because of obstacles at the end of the airstrip, he elected to abort the takeoff.    The pilot reported that he applied maximum braking; however, the airplane continued off the end of the runway.  The airplane traveled through a fence and came to stop in a wooded area off the end of the airstrip. PROBABLE CAUSE:a sudden shift in wind direction which resulted in diminished airspeed during takeoff."

        "details": "The pilot and passenger departed on a local flight in the amateur-built experimental airplane using an intersection departure from the runway. Several frames of a surveillance video that captured the airplane during the initial climb from the runway showed a thin white trail of vapor/smoke behind the airplane. GPS data recovered from the airplane indicated that the airplane climbed to about 100 ft above ground level, leveled off, turned left at the end of the runway, and entered a descent. Shortly thereafter, the airplane collided with parked vehicles about 0.25 miles from the departure end of runway. Examination of the accident site indicated that the airplane impacted in a near-vertical attitude, consistent with an aerodynamic stall.  During examination of the wreckage, no evidence of airframe malfunction or failure was detected. The propeller displayed no evidence of rotational damage, consistent with a loss of engine power before impact. The engine's turbocharger would not rotate, and the turbocharger compressor housing displayed impact marks made by the compressor wheel, indicating that there was little relative motion between the blades and the housing at the time of the impact. The turbocharger's wastegate system was tested on an exemplar engine, and no anomalies were noted. It could not be determined whether the turbocharger would not rotate due to impact damage or whether it seized in flight resulting in a partial loss of engine power. Engine test runs with a turbocharger in a seized condition could not be conducted.   The mixture control lever was found near the idle-cutoff position with a corresponding witness/impact mark around the circumference of the control stem, indicating that the lever was in the cutoff position at the time of impact. It could not be determined at what point during the flight the lever was moved to the cutoff position. Attempts to produce white smoke from the engine by leaning the mixture to the cutoff position and by inducing a loss of engine power due to water contamination were unsuccessful. The exemplar engine's failure to produce white smoke when the mixture was leaned suggests that the loss of engine power was not the result of the pilot moving the mixture control lever to the cutoff position during takeoff. It is possible that the pilot moved the lever to the cutoff position after the airplane departed from controlled flight. The reason for the loss of engine power could not be determined.  The circumstances of the accident are consistent with the pilot failing to maintain sufficient airspeed following a loss of engine power during takeoff, resulting in the airplane's wing exceeding its critical angle-of-attack and a subsequent aerodynamic stall. Instead of using the full runway length of 6,179 ft, the pilot elected an intersection takeoff with about 2,570 ft of available runway. Calculations showed that, had the pilot used the entire runway for takeoff, sufficient runway for a landing following the loss of engine power would likely have been available.  Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to maintain sufficient airspeed following a loss of engine power during initial takeoff climb, which resulted in the airplane's wing exceeding its critical angle-of-attack and a subsequent aerodynamic stall. The reason for the loss of engine power could not be determined because examination of the wreckage revealed no mechanical deficiencies. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's decision to conduct an intersection takeoff."

        "details": "Having leveled off at cruise altitude, the passenger began to smell an electrical burning odor in the experimental airplane's cabin. Smoke then began to stream from the lower center console to the right of the pilot’s footwell. The passenger attempted to locate the source of the smoke while the pilot initiated an emergency descent. Shortly before landing, the footwell became engulfed in flames. During the landing flare, the airplane struck a group of trees and collided with a berm.   The majority of the airplane was consumed by fire; however, examination of the electrical wiring revealed arcing damage to one of the primary electrical supply lines in the area where the passenger reported the first traces of smoke. The wire connected the master solenoid to the airplane’s main system bus.  It is most likely that the wire’s insulation had become compromised, leading to its electrical conductor coming into contact with a metallic airframe component, resulting in a short circuit and fire. The pilot shut off the master solenoid during the descent, which would have halted the short circuit; but by then the fire had most likely already spread, possibly igniting the fuel supply components in that area. The fact that the master solenoid was off also negated the possibility that the short circuit occurred during the ground impact sequence.  The airplane’s construction consisted of automotive electrical wire and household PVC tubing for electrical conduit. Additionally, the battery and associated master solenoid wiring had been relocated three times since the airplane’s completion; however, it could not be determined if this construction or modification caused or contributed to the short circuit.  Probable Cause: An in-flight fire due to an electrical short circuit."

        "details": "The owner/builder reported that the accident flight was the fourth test flight for the experimental airplane. One of the three ground crewmembers reported that, for this flight, the pilot wanted to test the airplane’s G limits, perform stalls, and conduct touch-and-go takeoffs and landings. While the pilot was flying the airplane in the traffic pattern, two of the ground crewmembers observed the airplane perform an unscheduled roll. About 1 minute later, they observed the airplane perform a second roll. One of the ground crewmembers reported that, about midway through the second roll, the pilot lost airplane control, and the ballistic parachute subsequently deployed with the airplane traveling at a high rate of speed; almost immediately after deployment, the parachute separated from the airframe. The airplane then spun toward the ground and was destroyed by impact forces. The Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH) contained a warning that aerobatics and intentional spins were prohibited. The POH also indicated that the minimum deployment altitude for the parachute was 210 ft and recommended that the parachute be deployed at the lowest airspeed possible and not above 150 mph; the airplane was operating at the airport’s traffic pattern altitude of about 1,000 ft above ground level when the parachute deployed. The airplane’s never-exceed speed was 131 mph; theairplane’s actual speed at the time of the parachute’s deployment could not be determined. Although the airplane was likely traveling within the speed and altitude specified for parachute deployment, the pilot was performing a prohibited roll when it deployed.  All of the parachute system’s hardware was accounted for during the postaccident examination of the system. The examination of the three parachute lines that were attached to the fuselage per the kit specifications revealed that two of the lines had been cut and that the third line exhibited overstress fractures. It is likely that the lines were severed when the parachute was deployed during the roll and that the remaining line then failed due to overload. Due to the severity of the damage and fragmentation of the airframe, it could not be determined if the pilot intentionally deployed the parachute following the loss of control during the roll maneuver or if a malfunction occurred that caused the parachute to deploy unintentionally. Once the parachute separated, the airplane was likely uncontrollable. Although postaccident toxicological tests detected chlorpheniramine, a sedating antihistamine, in the pilot’s cavity, it is unlikely that the pilot was impaired at the time of the accident.  Probable Cause: The pilot’s failure to maintain airplane control while performing prohibited aerobatic maneuvers and the deployment and separation of the ballistic parachute system from the airframe for reasons that could not be determined due to the severity of impact damage to the system."

He landed and over the next 3 days the engine was repaired.  When his friend returned they both departed for Texas.  They did not filed a flight plan, nor was a weather briefing obtained.  About 105 nautical miles into the flight, they encountered fog and low ceilings.  They performed a 180 degree turn and reversed directions.  The pilot of N123SC, stated he lost control of the aircraft as he began his turn behind the lead aircraft.  He tried to regain control of the airplane, but all control inputs failed to control the aircraft.  The next thing he saw, was the trees and ground coming up towards him.  Examination of the wreckage revealed, the control stick was actuated fore and aft, left and right with positive input to all control surfaces that were still intact on the aircraft.  It was the opinion of the FAA inspector, '...that weather, fog, low ceilings, lack of instrumentation and the pilot flying in marginally VFR to IFR weather without an instrument rating, possibly contributed to a loss of control, secondarily to some buffeting by the lead aircraft, and then possibly an accelerated stall.  The reported weather at Natchez-Adams Airport (HEZ), located about 15 miles west of the crash site was: lowest ceiling: 200 overcast, visibility: 2 1/2 miles, temperature 63 degrees F, dew point: 63 degrees F, wind from 020 degrees, at 6 knots, and the altimeter 30.16 inHg.  Probable Cause: an inadvertent stall at too low altitude to allow recovery.  Factors in this accident were fog and low ceilings."

        "details": "The commercial pilot and three passengers departed on an instrument flight rules cross-country flight. While on approach to the destination airport, the pilot indicated to the air traffic controller that the airplane was passing through areas of moderate-to-extreme precipitation. After clearing the airplane for the approach, the controller noted that the airplane descended below its assigned altitude; the controller issued a low altitude alert, but no response was received from the pilot.   The airplane subsequently impacted terrain in a level attitude about 12 miles from the airport. Examination of the airframe, engine, and system components revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunction that would have precluded normal operation. An area of disturbed, flattened, tall grass was located about 450 ft southwest of the accident site. Based on the images of the grass, the National Weather Service estimated that it would take greater than 35 knots of wind to lay over tall grass as the images indicated, and that a downburst/microburst event could not be ruled out. A downburst is an intense downdraft that creates strong, often damaging winds.  About 6 hours before the flight, the pilot obtained weather information through a mobile application. Review of weather data indicated the presence of strong winds, heavy precipitation, turbulence, and low-level wind shear (LLWS) in the area at the time of arrival, which was reflected in the information the pilot received. Given the weather conditions, it is likely that the airplane encountered an intense downdraft, or downburst, which would have resulted in a sudden, major change in wind velocity. The airplane was on approach for landing at the time and was particularly susceptible to this hazardous condition given its lower altitude and slower airspeed. The downburst likely exceeded the climb performance capabilities of the airplane and resulted in a subsequent descent into terrain.  It is unknown if the accident pilot checked or received additional weather information before or during the accident flight. While the flight was en route, several PIREPs were issued for the area of the accident site, which also indicated the potential of LLWS near the destination airport; however, the controller did not provide this information to the pilot, nor did he solicit PIREP information from the pilot.   Based on published Federal Aviation Administration guidance for controllers and the widespread adverse weather conditions in the vicinity of the accident site, the controller should have both solicited PIREP information from the pilot and disseminated information from previous PIREPs to him; this would have provided the pilot with more complete information about the conditions to expect during the approach and landing at the destination.  Probable Cause: An encounter with a downburst during an instrument approach, which resulted in a loss of control at low altitude. Contributing to the accident was the air traffic controller's failure to solicit and disseminate pilot reports from arriving and departing aircraft in order to provide pilots with current and useful weather information near the airport."

The ERJ-190 was on final approach to runway 04R and had been cleared to land. The Boston tower controller had instructed the pilot of the Learjet to line up and wait on runway 9 for departure. Both runways intersect.  The Learjet's flight crew read back the controller’s instructions to line up and wait, however they began the takeoff-roll instead. The airport surface detection equipment, model X (ASDE-X) alerted, and the controller issued go-around instructions to B6206. B6206’s flight crew initiated a go-around while over runway 04R, prior to reaching the intersection with runway 09. The ERJ-190 landed safely 12 minutes later. The Learjet continued to the destination, Fort Lauderdale, FL (FXE).  The closest estimated position was 331 feet lateral. The FAA rated the incident a Category A runway incursion.  Probable Cause and Findings The Hop-a-Jet flight crew taking off without a takeoff clearance which resulted in a conflict with a JetBlue flight that had been cleared to land on an intersecting runway."

The pilot reported that he departed from a flatbed truck with about 70 to 75 gallons of chemical onboard, and flew south for about 1 mile, about 100 ft above ground level. Suddenly, the helicopter began to make a loud noise and “vibrate badly.” The pilot stated that he didn’t know if he was losing rotor rpm and initiated an autorotation to a field.  Postaccident examination of the helicopter revealed that the KAflex coupling, and isolator mount were substantially damaged. The helicopter was recovered to a secure location for further examination."

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed.  The helicopter was destroyed by impact damage and post-crash fire. Both the flight instructor and private pilot were fatally injured.  The flight originated from Boeing Field, Seattle, Washington, about 15 minutes prior to the accident.  Most witnesses were at various locations on the Trophy Lake Golf Course located about one-quarter to one-half mile away. One witness reported that he heard a sound and glanced up to see the helicopter initially travelling toward the golf course, then looked as if forward flight stopped before it made \"some radical flight maneuvers.\" The witness described a sound difference with the main rotors before it lost 75 to 100 feet in altitude. The helicopter then made a \"radical snap roll\" maneuver before beginning a \"cork-screw\" dive. Prior to impact, the witness noticed that at about 200 to 250 feet above ground level, the tail rotors separated followed by the tail section separation at about 100 to 150 feet AGL. The witness then lost sight of the helicopter in the trees. Shortly thereafter, the witness heard an explosion and observed smoke. One other witness reported similar circumstances.  Several other witnesses reported hearing a \"loud bang,\" \"popping,\" \"coughing,\" or \"rough running\" engine noise which brought their attention to the helicopter. Each of the witnesses reported observing the helicopter in a \"nose down\" or \"wobbling\" attitude while it spun, nose left, to ground impact. Prior to ground impact, the witnesses observed an object or objects separating from the helicopter.   Probable Cause: An abrupt application of the tail rotor/anti-torque pedal by an unknown pilot resulting in tail rotor contact with the tail boom. Tail rotor blades and empennage assembly separation, and trees were factors.  NOTE: The NTSB report gives the crash location as 'about 3 miles South of Gorst, Washington'. A Contemporary newspaper report (see link #3) gives the crash location as 'near Lake Flora Road, Calvinwood, about a quarter-mile north of Trophy Lake Golf Course in South Kitsap\". The same report named the two fatalities thus: ' Two Seattle men were killed Friday morning when a helicopter crashed and burned in thick woods. The victims were identified as Robert E. LaPrarie, 59, and Wade C. Carter, 71, both of Seattle, Kitsap Coroner Greg Sandstrom said. Carter was the owner of Carter Subaru in Seattle. LaPrarie was an employee of Classic Helicopter Corp. of Seattle, which owned the Robinson 44 aircraft'."

        "details": "While in cruise flight about 1,700 feet agl, the flight instructor heard a loud \"bang\" from the back of the helicopter.  The alternator warning light illuminated, and he initiated the alternator emergency procedure.  He noticed the engine's rpm was fluctuating with the main rotor rpm indicating high and the engine rpm low.  He entered an autorotation and landed on uneven terrain; the main rotor struck the tail boom, and the helicopter rolled over onto its left side.  The helicopter was examined by a Safety Board investigator.  The two main drive V-belts were located in the drive compartment with one positioned on the drive pulleys in the middle slot (between the normal operating positions for the forward and aft belts), and the other was located completely off of the drive pulleys.  Both belts exhibited damage on the inside including scratch marks, material and color transfers, and gouges consistent with damage by a rubber based foreign object.  Rubber and color transfer in a transverse orientation inconsistent with the drive belts was noted on the upper and lower pulleys.  The alternator belt was missing and not recovered.  The clutch assembly was located in the up position with the actuator fully extended, and the safety stop activated.  The oil cooler sustained damage to the outer fins.  Rubber transfer was located on the oil cooler, starter, oil lines, and exhaust tube on a plane with the alternator belt's rotation.  The alternator belt is located directly below the lower main drive pulley.  No other preimpact anomalies with either the airframe or engine were discovered.  As a result of this investigation Robinson is changing the specification for the alternator drive belt.  Probable Cause: a failure of the main rotor drive system V-belts due to damage sustained when the alternator drive belt failed and pieces of that belt got between the main drive belts and their associated pulleys.  A contributing factor was the uneven terrain encountered in the forced landing."

        "details": "On the morning of the visual flight rules flight, the non-instrument-rated pilot obtained a verbal weather briefing and stated that he planned to depart early afternoon, with an expected flight duration of about 3 hours. The pilot was advised of the possibility of turbulence and clouds along his route, which was primarily over mountainous terrain, with cloud tops forecast to be 25,000 feet and above. There were no records of any subsequent telephonic or computer weather briefings, and the pilot did not file a flight plan.   Although the pilot did not communicate with air traffic control (ATC), ground-based ATC radar captured the majority of the flight. When the airplane was reported overdue by relatives of one of the passengers, the radar data were used to search for and locate the airplane, which had impacted terrain in a remote wilderness area about 110 miles from the departure airport. Evaluation of the radar data indicated that the total flight duration was about 1 hour and that the airplane was above 12,500 feet for about 28 minutes and above 14,000 feet for about 8 minutes. The last 2 minutes of radar data depicted a course reversal, followed by an erratic course and an irregular, rapid descent. Meteorological data indicated that broken or overcast cloud base altitudes ranged from about 7,000 to 10,000 feet, with tops near 28,000 feet and that icing conditions could be expected in the clouds above about 10,000 feet. Terrain elevations within 30 miles of the impact site ranged from about 4,000 to 7,000 feet.   Wreckage patterns and ground scars indicated a near-vertical impact trajectory. A supplemental oxygen tank was present in the wreckage, but the tank inspection expired 8 years before the accident, and no hoses or masks were present. Postaccident examination of the airplane and engine did not reveal any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.   The radar ground track was consistent with the pilot trying to find a route clear of the clouds. The pilot's lack of an instrument rating, combined with the erratic ground track, rapid descent, and steep impact angle, indicated that the pilot lost control of the airplane after it entered clouds. Available evidence supported the likelihood of spatial disorientation, as well as the possibility of hypoxia. Probable Cause: The non-instrument-rated pilot's decision to conduct a visual flight rules flight over mountainous terrain into a region covered by clouds, which likely resulted in spatial disorientation and subsequent loss of airplane control."

On his second landing, while on short final, the glidepath was lower than normal, and he increased the power setting to extend the glide. After the airplane crossed the runway threshold, he flared slightly high and leveled the airplane to keep it from sinking too fast. The airplane bounced slightly on touchdown, and he overcorrected with rudder inputs due to a crosswind. The airplane rolled forward, and the tail began to rise. The flight instructor reported that, at this point, he took over control of the airplane and applied back stick pressure; however, the airflow was too slow over the elevator flight control surface to have effect, and the airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted. The left-wing lift strut and rudder were substantially damaged. The student and instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.  Probable Cause: The student pilot's improper landing flare in crosswind conditions, which resulted in a bounced landing, and his subsequent loss of airplane control after overcorrecting with rudder. Contributing to the accident was the flight instructor's delayed remedial action, which resulted in a nose-over."

        "details": "The pilot was performing low-level surveillance operations, and had extended the flaps to 10 degrees, descended to about 1,400 feet mean sea level, set the engine power at about 18 inches of manifold pressure, trimmed the aircraft, and began to grid search the area.  Coming to the end of his search area he banked the aircraft 180 degrees to a northerly, downwind direction, added power, and began another pass.  While making the pass, he felt the controls become \"mushy\" and the airplane began to settle.  He added a little power, but noticed \"no response\" to the aircraft controls.  He then added full power and attempted to turn the airplane into the wind; however, the directional control continued to deteriorate, and it became evident that he was in a \"stall situation.\"  Subsequently, the airplane impacted trees and came to rest inverted on the ground.    Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to maintain airspeed which resulted in a inadvertent stall.  Contributing factors were the low altitude and high wind."

Shortly thereafter, the left engine began 'slowly spooling down' and the airplane was not able to maintain airspeed and altitude. The pilot performed a forced landing to a flat, muddy wheat field, resulting in substantial damage. A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no anomalies. There was no evidence of fuel at the accident site or in the airplane. During the recovery of the airplane from the field, no fuel was found in the three intact fuel tanks nor in any of the engine fuel lines. The pilot later stated that he ran the airplane out of fuel.   Probable Cause: The pilot's improper fuel planning and management, which resulted in a total loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion."

Parts from the aircraft were found some distance from the accident site.  The propeller along with the severed crankshaft flange were found still bolted together less part of one propeller blade.  Metallurgical examination revealed that a blade had failed midspan due to fatigue.  The propeller was being operated above the design rpm red line of 2,700.  Additionally, the propeller was being subjected to gyroscopic aerobatic loads.  An rpm restriction for the propeller mandated by an airworthiness directive was not placarded on the instrument panel per the AD.  The engine was designed for a type certificated helicopter application and was approved for a 3,200 rpm red line.  CAUSE: the operation of the propeller beyond the design rpm limitations and the resultant gyroscopic loads from aerobatics. Contributing to the accident was the lack of a required instrument panel rpm restriction for the propeller mandated by an airworthiness directive."

The airplane was destroyed by impact forces and postimpact fire, to include all engine accessories, the cockpit, and fuel system.  A witness heard the pilot announce that he was on a 2 mile final to runway 23 and no additional transmissions were heard.  Other witnesses saw the airplane make a descending, low, sweeping turn to the southwest just above the tree line, in a left wing down attitude just prior to the collision with the trees and residence 1 mile west of the airport.  The engine was disassembled and examined with no anomalies noted which would have precluded the engine from producing power.  The landing gear was in the down position, and the fuel selector was in the off position.  Fuel load and usage was reconstructed based upon the distance between the origin and destination airports.  The trip required 15 gallons of fuel.  The airplane's last known fueling was on July 17th at the departure airport, when each wing tank was filled with 10 gallons.  It is not known how much fuel was present in each tank prior to this fueling. Flight hours subsequent to the July 17th fueling could not be determined. Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine, was detected in the pilot's blood at 0.186 ug/ml, and in the liver at 1.594 ug/ml  CAUSE: A loss of engine power for undetermined reasons."

The pilot was an airplane mechanic, and he was in the process of preparing the airplane for export.  The accident occurred during the first flight following his replacement of both engines' propeller assemblies.  On departure, while concentrating on synchronizing the engine's speed, the pilot detected \"a slight smell of electrical burning\" in the cockpit.  The odor increased on the downwind leg, and the pilot \"expedited\" the base leg and believed that he had extended the landing gear.  During the landing flare the stall warning horn sounded and the propeller blades contacted the runway.  Subsequently, the Federal Aviation Administration coordinator conducted an examination of the airplane.  The airplane was placed on jacks and the landing gear system was tested.  The landing gear was completely cycled three times with positive indications of the gear being up and then in the down position.  This was noted by the gear up and down indicator lights, and also by the gear mechanical indicator.  The starter vibrator was found discolored and charred indicating the presence of an overheated condition.  Probable Cause: the pilot's failure to lower the landing gear during landing approach, which resulted in his inadvertent gear up landing.  A factor was his distraction due to a component malfunction."

As the airplane approached a saddle in the terrain the pilot spotted 2 black bears. The pilot entered a descent and executed a right turn to orbit the bears. After a 360-degree turn he realized that the airplane had descended too low and was approaching rising terrain. The airplane's slow airspeed and angle of bank did not allow for recovery and the airplane subsequently collided with the terrain and nosed over. The wings and fuselage were substantially damaged.

The engine lost power on takeoff, and the airplane impacted a field. Examination of the airplane and engine revealed no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation; however the mixture control lever, which was located below and to the left of the rear-seated pilot's left knee (there was no mixture control in the front seat), was pulled out about 2 inches. The lever should have been full forward during takeoff. The propeller control was situated directly below the mixture control and found in the full forward position. The propeller control lever is usually adjusted by the pilot after takeoff. Although the mixture and propeller control levers were color-coded, it's possible that the 6'5\" private pilot's left knee blocked his view of the controls due to his size and the small cockpit. The mixture control knob was slightly larger than the propeller control knob, but both were similar in shape. It is possible that the pilot thought he was adjusting the propeller control rather than the mixture control on takeoff and inadvertently shut off fuel to the engine. Postaccident examination of the mixture control cable from the cockpit to the engine revealed it moved freely and there was no evidence it had been moved during impact. Probable Cause: The pilot’s inadvertent pulling of the mixture control lever on takeoff, which shut down the engine."

        "details": "The pilot reported that, at the beginning of the day, each of the main fuel tanks was about 7/8ths full.  He completed two aerial sightseeing flights and was making a third flight. The airplane was about 2 nautical miles from the airport, which was located on an island, when, following a left turn climbing maneuver, the engine began to surge. The pilot elected to perform a forced landing in the ocean. Despite the fact that the engine stopped surging and began producing “almost takeoff power” when the airplane was about 500 feet above ground level, the pilot opted to continue with the ditching. Upon impact with the water, the bi-wing airplane nosed over and sustained substantial damage to both left wings. After the airplane was recovered from the water, about 4 gallons of fuel and 16 gallons of sea water were drained from the 36-gallon capacity left fuel tank; there was no fuel in the 36-gallon right fuel tank. Neither fuel tank had been breached. During a postaccident examination of the airframe and engine, no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures were found that would have precluded normal engine operation. Given the low fuel quantity, it is likely that, during the left turn climbing maneuver, the fuel tank inlet was unported, and air was introduced into the system, which caused the engine surge. Once the climbing turn was stopped, normal fuel flow began and engine operation resumed.  It was noted that the wires attached to the cork floats of each of the two fuel quantity sight gauges were bent and that this was causing the gauges to register a fuel quantity of 7/8ths, irrespective of the actual fuel quantity. It could not be determined if the wires were bent before the accident or as a result of the impact. If the wires were bent before the accident, then the pilot should have recognized that the indicated fuel quantity was not changing during the first and second flights of the day and should have taken further action to verify the actual fuel quantity aboard the airplane before initiating the accident flight. If the wires were bent as a result of the impact, then the fuel gauges would have been working properly, and the pilot should have noted the low fuel quantity and refueled the airplane before initiating the accident flight. Probable Cause:  The pilot did not ensure that there was sufficient fuel aboard the airplane before initiating the flight, which resulted in temporary fuel starvation and an interruption in engine power during maneuvering.  Contributing to the accident was the pilot’s decision to continue with the ditching after engine power was restored."

The pilot and co-pilot were not injured, but the cabin attendant was seriously injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 positioning flight.  The pilot in command (PIC) reported that the airplane arrived at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) San Francisco, California, about 1130 from Shively Field Airport, Saratoga, Wyoming. Five passengers deplaned and a new cabin attendant joined the current crew. After briefing and complete their appropriate checklist, the airplane, with the co-pilot on the flight controls, departed to the east for a reposition flight to Page Municipal Airport (PGA), Page, Arizona. As the airplane climbed through FL200, an amber CAS message appeared, “AP [autopilot] Trim Fail”. The PIC began to review a checklist to troubleshoot when a second amber CAS message appeared, “AP holding nose DN [down]. The PIC resumed control of the airplane after a positive exchange. Shortly after, the autopilot disconnected. The airplane immediately pitched up and after a couple oscillations, the PIC was able to steady the airplane into straight and level flight. During this time, the cabin attendant reported to the flight crew that she was seriously injured.   The airplane returned to SFO without further incident and the cabin attendant received medical treatment for serious injuries.   The airplane was secured for further examination."

        "details": "Witnesses observed the aircraft perform a rolling takeoff and it was airborne by the crossing runway (1,300 feet down the 6,600 foot runway).  The aircraft entered an approximate 40 degree nose high climb rate to about 1,000 feet.  The aircraft then entered a steep left hand banking turn.  The nose dropped and the aircraft rotated up to about 4 times before colliding with the flat terrain adjacent to the departure end of the runway threshold.   On site documentation of the airframe found no evidence of a flight control malfunction.  An engine examination and teardown found that the gearbox section of the left engine experienced a high cycle fatigue failure of the high speed pinion journal bearing oil supply tube and subsequent degradation of the high speed pinion journal bearings.  This failure resulted in a partial power loss to the left engine.   The pilot had recently purchased this aircraft and he had accumulated approximately 11 hours since the purchase.  The pilot had stated to personnel at the place where he purchased the aircraft that he had not received, nor did he need recurrent training in this aircraft as he had several thousand hours in the aircraft.  Flight logs provided by the family indicated that the pilot had accumulated about 551 hours in a Mitsubishi, however, the last time that the pilot had flown this make and model was 14 years prior to the accident.  Logbook entries indicated that only a few hours of flight time had been accumulated in all aircraft during the approximately 2 years prior to the accident.  Personnel that flew with the pilot in the make and model aircraft involved in the accident described the pilot as \"proficiency lacking.\"  Normal takeoff calculations for the aircraft with the flaps configured to 5 degrees, indicated a ground run of 2,900 feet,  with a rotation speed of 106 KCAS, and 125 KCAS for the climb out.  A maximum pitch attitude of 13 degrees maximum is indicated.  Performance calculations indicated that the aircraft was capable of lifting off where the witnesses observed and climbing to 1,000 feet agl by the end of the runway.  To achieve this performance the aircraft would have rotated at approximately 84 KCAS and climbed at an airspeed below Vmc (100 KCAS) and close to power-off stall speed (86 KCAS) with 5 degrees of flaps.  The airplane's flight manual indicated that if an engine failure occurs in the takeoff climb and the landing gear is fully retracted, the emergency procedures is to maintain 140 KCAS, flaps to 5 degrees, the failed engine condition lever to EMERGENCY STOP, and failed engine power lever to TAKEOFF.  On site documentation found the left side condition lever in the takeoff/land position and the power lever was found half-way between takeoff and flight idle. Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to obtain minimum controllable airspeed during the takeoff climb, which resulted in a loss of aircraft control when the left engine lost partial power.  A fatigue failure to an oil tube, which resulted in the partial power loss to the left engine, procedures/directives not followed by the pilot, and the pilot's lack of recent experience and no recurrent training in the type of aircraft were factors."

The pilot also declined to hear an airman's meteorological notice (AIRMET), which forecast areas of instrument flight conditions and mountain obscuration along his route of flight.  The pilot was advised by the briefer that VFR flight was not recommended.  Probable Cause: The failure of the pilot to maintain altitude and clearance from terrain during a turn to reverse direction after encountering instrument meteorological conditions.

        "details": "On January 12, 2022, about 1427 eastern standard time, a Piper J3C-65 airplane, N88509, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Winter Haven, Florida. The flight instructor and pilot receiving instruction sustained serious injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 instructional flight.  The pilot receiving instruction had not flown a float-equipped airplane in 3 years, so the flight instructor considered the training flights as review. The flight instructor stated that, during their 2-hour morning flight, the pilot receiving instruction sat in the front seat and that he tended to “fly too slow” and “turn sharply.” The instructor had to “push the nose down on several occasions.” After eating lunch and refueling the airplane, the afternoon flight began, with the pilot receiving instruction sitting in the rear seat. The flight instructor estimated that they had been flying for about 1 hour when the accident occurred. Neither the flight instructor nor the pilot receiving instruction had recollection of the accident, but the flight instructor recalled thinking that the pilot receiving instruction might not have been able to see the instruments well from the rear seat or that he was being inattentive.  A witness stated that the airplane made two passes over a lake and that, as the airplane descended toward the lake during the second pass, the right float made a small splash as it touched the water. The airplane then climbed a couple hundred feet, turned to the right in a steep angle, and descended toward the ground in a near-vertical nose-down attitude. The witness did not hear the engine during the descent.  Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. Given the reported application of carburetor heat during all approaches, it is unlikely that carburetor icing affected engine performance.  After learning about the witness’ observations, the flight instructor stated that the pilot receiving instruction had been “making really steep turns” and “was too slow on airspeed.” The flight instructor further stated that he was too slow to correct the pilot. Thus, it is likely that the pilot receiving instruction maintained insufficient airspeed and banked too steeply, which resulted in an exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack and a subsequent aerodynamic stall, and that the flight instructor did not take action in time to prevent the accident.  Probable Cause: The pilot receiving instruction’s failure to maintain airspeed during a turn, which resulted in an exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack and a subsequent aerodynamic stall. Contributing to the accident was the flight instructor’s failure to take remedial action in a timely manner."

The purpose of the accident flight was to practice touch-and-go landings. The first two were uneventful, but during the third touch-and-go, he applied power to take off again and the gyroplane rolled to the left. The pilot overcorrected and rolled the gyroplane right, resulting in the main rotor blades contacting the ground. The gyroplane slid on the runway to a stop on its right side resulting in substantial damage to main rotor blades and tail section. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the gyroplane that would have precluded normal operation.  Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to maintain control of the gyroplane during a touch-and-go landing."

The parking maneuver was performed without the assistance of a marshaller because this parking position is considered a remote location where each user must provide their own services.  While turning to park, the upper end of the vertical stabilizer and the rudder made contact with the right wingtip of the Boeing 777 aircraft, which was parked while being prepared for a flight.  The accident occurred during daylight hours, and weather conditions did not contribute to the incident.  CAUSE: During the parking maneuver, collision of the vertical stabilizer and rudder with the right wingtip of a parked aircraft due to an error in calculating the turning radius.  Contributing factor: Parking without the assistance of a marshaller."

        "details": "A Boeing 777-223ER aircraft, registration N758AN, operated by American Airlines, was preparing to carry out flight AA037 from Madrid-Barajas Adolfo Suárez Airport, Spain to the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, United States. It was stopped on taxiway Z1 awaiting clearance to enter runway 36L. An Airbus A-330-300, registration EC-LZX, operated by Iberia, had landed on runway 32L inbound from the Miami Airport, United States, on flight IB6118. Its crew had been instructed to taxi on standard route B to gate 12.  As it neared the intersection of taxiways B2, B3 and Z1, the flight crew commented on the position of the Boeing. The first officer asked the captiain if he should radio the controller to have the Boeing move forward. The captain replied: \"No, no, we can make it.\" As the aircraft continued to taxy, the left wing on the A330 struck the right elevator on the Boeing 777, causing a crack on the lower surface. The A330 continued taxiing, which resulted in its left winglet impacting the right wingtip on the Boeing 777.  The investigation has determined that this incident occurred due to the decision of the crew of aircraft EC-LZX to continue taxiing behind aircraft N758AN even though its crew were aware that this aircraft was very close to the taxiway they were taxiing on.  The following factors contributed to this incident: •  Aircraft N758AN had stopped 40 m away from the holding point sign for runway 36L, such that it was encroaching on the strip of taxiway B. •  The failure by Jeppesen to include in its airport information a note from the aerodrome map for ground movements (ICAO) published in the AIP Spain stating that “aircraft shall taxi as close as possible to runway and intermediate holding points...”"

There were no injuries and the airplane received substantial damage. According to flight crew statements, the crew advised the tug driver they were cleared to push back, either tail east or straight back. At the time of the accident, dark night conditions existed and the ramp was contaminated with snow.  During the pushback, the flight crew started No. 1 and 2 engines. The tug driver pushed the airplane back with its empennage towards the east and then notified the captain that he would pull forward to straighten them out. As the tug driver pulled the airplane forward and was coming to a stop the airplane's nose began to drift to the left. The tug detached from the airplane and impacted the right forward fuselage and right engine air intake resulting in substantial damage. The captain noted that the nose swung to the left, and then said it felt as if the airplane was moving backwards.  According to the operator, on the morning of the accident, the ramp management company had instructed their ground personnel that all pushbacks should be straight back pushes due to the snowy conditions. It is likely that the angle of the towbar from pushing the airplane back to the east, combined with the snow contaminated ramp and the engine idle thrust, caused the tug driver to lose control of the tug during the pushback."

During the approach to the field, the left wing dropped and the airplane turned to the left before impact. A postaccident examination of the number one cylinder exhaust port revealed an accumulation of carbon. The number one cylinder's spark plug could be loosened by hand in indication that it was not properly secured prior to impact; removal of that plug revealed that it exhibited a fouled appearance. The engine's maintenance manual indicated that the spark plugs are to be tightened on a cold engine to 240-inch pounds of torque. The airplane's airworthiness was maintained by the owner/pilot under a conditional maintenance program.  Probable Cause: A loss of engine power due to the improper torquing of the number one cylinder's spark plug as a result of inadequate maintenance."

The accident flight was the fourth test flight of the day to diagnose and fix the issue. Duringtakeoff, the airplane \"quickly\" became airborne and began to roll to the left about 15 ft above the ground. The pilot applied full right aileron; however, the airplane continued to roll left and descend, and the airplane impacted the ground in a left-wing-low attitude, resulting in substantial damage to the left wing spar, bottom fuselage, cowling, engine, landing gear, and firewall. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed improper rigging of the ailerons. The improper rigging and improper aileron cable tensions most likely resulted in a loss of aileron control during takeoff.    Probable Cause: The airplane owner's and mechanic's improper rigging and cable tension of the aileron control system, which resulted in a loss of control during takeoff."

While he was descending the airplane through 6,500 ft mean sea level and drawing fuel from the right tank, the engine lost total power. The pilot switched to the left fuel tank, turned on the fuel pump, and engaged the engine starter in an attempt to restart the engine to no avail. The pilot subsequently conducted a forced landing, during which the airplane collided with a power line, and the left aileron and fuselage sustained substantial damage.   Examinations of the airframe, fuel system, and engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation, and the engine was test-run successfully. At recovery, 2 gallons of fuel were found in the left fuel tank (although a small amount had leaked from the damaged fuel drain), and 9 gallons of fuel were found in the right fuel tank. The investigation could not determine the reason for the engine power loss.  The Pilot’s Operating Handbook engine restart procedures stated, in part, to select the fuller fuel tank. Given that there was adequate fuel onboard when the engine lost power, if the pilot had properly conducted the engine restart procedures by selecting the fuller fuel tank, it is possible that engine power could have been restored.    Probable Cause: The total loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined because examination of the engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation."

It came to rest on its left side with both wings separated and the fuselage was highly fragmented forward of the main landing gear. A post-accident examination of the airframe and engines found no mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. A witness that spoke to the pilot shortly before the accident flight stated that the pilot exhibited difficulty in completing some paperwork; however, no medical reasoning for this difficulty could be determined based upon the available evidence. The investigation determined that at the time of the accident the pilot had been on duty for about 19 hours and 20 minutes, which was contrary to duty and rest regulations. At his estimated arrival time into the destination, the pilot would have accumulated about 20 hours and 54 minutes of duty time. The investigation was unable to determine if the pilot took advantage of the opportunity for rest that existed during the day, and therefore could not determine if fatigue contributed to the accident. Investigators were unable to determine the reason for the loss of control on takeoff with the available information.

The pilot made a forced landing in a marsh about 1/4-mile beyond the runway's departure end.  After the airplane came to rest upside down in the 2- to 4-foot-deep marsh, the pilot extricated himself and waded to the shore.  The pilot had refueled his airplane just before takeoff.  During takeoff, full engine power was initially developed with the fuel selector positioned to the \"Both\" tanks position.  Following the accident when the airplane was examined, no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunction was noted.  The engine's electric fuel pump switch was observed in the \"OFF\" position.  The pump switch was required to be \"ON\" during takeoff.  During the initial climb, the engine driven fuel pump likely had not pumped sufficient fuel to the engine to maintain power, which resulted in fuel starvation.    Probable Cause: A total loss of engine power during initial climb due to fuel starvation, which was caused by the pilot's failure to turn on the electric boost pump and an undetermined failure of the engine driven pump to supply sufficient fuel to the carburetor."

        "details": "The commercial pilot, who had a total flight experience of about 4,500 hours in conventional airplanes, was learning to fly weight-shift-control (WSC) aircraft with the expressed intent of purchasing a high-performance WSC aircraft. The pilot obtained all of his 13.5 hours of WSC experience, including his WSC pilot and instructor certificates, in the 2 weeks before the accident in a docile, low performance WSC aircraft with dual seating. Despite being explicitly warned by his instructor that he was not \"not qualified\" to fly the specific model  high performance WSC aircraft involved in the accident, the pilot convinced an owner of a high-performance WSC aircraft to allow him to fly it solo. The owner reported that the engine start, taxi out, and run-up appeared normal. The wind was light. Witnesses reported that, on takeoff, the aircraft climbed rapidly and entered a steep right bank/roll from which it did not recover. The flight lasted about 16 seconds, and the aircraft reached a maximum altitude of about 80 ft above the runway. Detailed examination of the wreckage did not reveal any mechanical deficiencies or failures that would have precluded normal operation, and data from an electronic engine control indicated that the engine operated normally throughout the flight. The pilot's autopsy did not reveal the presence of any debilitating physical conditions or impairing drugs.  The pilot inputs for pitch and bank/roll control on a WSC aircraft are opposite those of conventional airplanes, and the pilot's experience differential between the two aircraft types was substantial. In addition, the high performance WSC aircraft was a much more powerful and challenging aircraft due to its control sensitivity than the one flown by the pilot during his limited WSC training, which was all done with an instructor. The witnesses' description of the sequence of events and the rapidity with which they occurred is consistent with excessive and contrary control inputs. Given the handling characteristics of the accident aircraft relative to the pilot's flight experience, it is likely that the pilot over-controlled it during the initial rotation, which led to what witnesses reported to be a very steep takeoff attitude. The lack of familiarity with the aircraft, combined with potential threat of a stall or other loss of control, and possible reversion to habit patterns appropriate to his conventional airplane experience may then have led to the pilot's reflexive and incorrect control inputs. Those inputs exacerbated the situation and ultimately resulted in a loss of aircraft control.  The aircraft was equipped with a rocket-powered parachute, but the first responders worked on and around the wreckage for about 1 hour before they were advised by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector of the presence of the rocket and its potential hazard. Existing industry consensus standards only specify warning placards near the rocket egress point, which in this case, was on the aircraft's left side. Because the aircraft came to rest on its left side, neither the rocket nor any placards would have been visible. ASTM International standards do not require that warning placards be placed on all sides of the aircraft.    Probable Cause: The pilot's improper decision to operate the high-performance aircraft despite warnings from a flight instructor that he did not have the experience to operate the aircraft that had different and more sensitive handling characteristics than the low-performance weight-shift-control aircraft that he was used to flying, which led to his improper control inputs and resulted in his loss of aircraft control and ground impact immediately after takeoff."

He said he elected to make a precautionary landing in a clear area as quickly as possible, and he did so too close to a 10-foot wide irrigation ditch. He said he performed a soft landing but did not realize that the helicopter was so close to the ditch. After the helicopter sat for a while, he said that the sand in the rear must have collapsed under the helicopter's rear center of gravity because the nose of the helicopter started to rise slowly, as the helicopter started to slide backwards. According to the pilot, the tail of the helicopter struck the opposite side of the irrigation ditch and the helicopter pivoted to the right, and came to rest in the ditch, in about 15 inches of water. An FAA inspector conducted postcrash examinations of the helicopter with the assistance of representatives from Bell Helicopter Company and Rolls-Royce Engines, and no anomalies were noted with the helicopter or any of its systems.  Probable Cause: The pilot's selection of an unsuitable area to make a precautionary landing which resulted in the helicopter rolling into a ditch."

The airplane was maneuvering at low altitude before it descended and then impacted the ground. Examination of the airplane revealed no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions. The forward fuselage and right wing were crushed, consistent with a nose-low, right-wing-low impact. The airplane's attitude at impact was consistent with a steep descending right turn that would occur after a stall. Based on the available information, it is likely that the pilot did not maintain adequate airspeed while maneuvering at a low altitude and exceeded the airplane’s critical angle-of-attack, which resulted in an aerodynamicstall. The airspeed indicator was marked for airspeeds from 40 to 340 mph, but the airplane's stall speed was 32 mph, and its maximum speed was 105 mph. The large discrepancy between the airplane's performance capability and the airspeed indicator markings made the airspeed indicator inappropriate for installation in the accident airplane and would not have provided the pilot airspeed information as he neared the stall speed. The lack of appropriate airspeed information due to the inappropriate airspeed indicator likely contributed to the pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed and prevent the stall. Probable Cause: The pilot’s failure to maintain adequate airspeed and his exceedance of the airplane’s critical angle-of-attack while maneuvering at low altitude,which led toan aerodynamicstall and loss of control. Contributing to the accident was the installation of an inappropriate airspeed indicator that did not provide airspeed indications near the airplane’s stall speed."

The airplane was substantially damaged. There were no injuries. The airplane pushed back from the gate, and taxied to runway 18L. While taxing, the crew heard no mention of a bird hazard by another aircraft or air traffic control. The takeoff roll was normal until passing approximately 150 knots; at that point, a flock of starling birds traveling from left to right passed in front of the airplane. The captain advised the first officer of the hazard, and asked him to climb over the flock. The first officer increased pitch angle, but the airplane still penetrated the flock. At the time of penetration, the nose wheel was in the air, and the main landing gear was just becoming airborne. The airplane returned to the airport without further incident. At the time of impact, N1 on the left engine dropped from 81.88 percent to 56.00 percent, and on the right engine, it dropped from 81.25 to 71.63 percent. In both cases, throttle positions remained constant. The bird's roost was not identified, and no airport procedures contributing to the accident were observed."

While level at 3,500 ft above ground level, the turbo propeller-equipped airplane experienced a total loss of engine power. The pilot attempted to restart the engine three times without success.  During the subsequent forced landing, the airplane struck a berm, which damaged both wings.  Examination of the engine revealed that fuel would not flow to the fuel nozzle until air pressure was bled upstream of the check valve assembly, located between the engine fuel control and the fuel nozzle. After the air pressure was bled and the fuel pump purged, normal fuel flow resumed, indicating that air had entered the fuel system. Because of the check valve assembly design, an in-flight engine restart was not possible after air entered the fuel line, and there was no procedure to clear air from the fuel line while in flight. Examination of the engine and fuel system could not establish a reason for air entering the fuel line.   Probable Cause: A total loss of engine power due to air entering the fuel system for reasons that could not be determined based on available information.  Contributing to the accident was the pilot’s inability to restart the engine due to the check valve assembly design."

The flight was operated as a training flight with two certificated airline transport pilots, a company pilot, and a company intern on board. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight plan had been filed for the flight which departed the Cincinnati Municipal/Lunken Field Airport.The pilot receiving instruction was performing an instrument approach to runway 28L, a 10,250 foot long, 150 foot wide, asphalt runway. Upon landing the airplane bounced slightly. At that point the crew heard a loud pop and the right wing started to dip. The airplane veered off the right side of runway 28L, and then impacted the \"C4\" taxiway sign located about 7,650 feet from the approach end of the runway.Examination of the landing gear components did not reveal any internal failures or malfunctions. Testing revealed it was possible for the side brace actuator to unlock mechanically by repeated cyclic compressive loading. The compressive load was cycled between near zero, up to values ranging from 1/2 the maximum limit value to near the maximum limit values. During testing, it required a minimum of 50 cycles before the side brace actuator could be induced to unlock."

        "details": "The Cessna 560XL airplane encountered ground and/or in-flight moisture/rain, that collected in the tailcone stinger and subsequently froze around the rudder cables during flight at an altitude above the freezing level. When the pilot attempted to use the rudder to initiate a crosswind correction during the landing flare, he was unable to move the rudder pedals, but was able to land the airplane uneventfully. In the days and weeks that followed, several other 560XL airplanes encountered the same problem. As a result, the airplane manufacturer issued a service bulletin recommending that drain holes be added in the tailcone stinger. The manufacturer had already added the drain holes in production airplanes, yet some production airplanes had drain holes that were not the indicated size. The manufacturer then issued an alert service letter to modify the stinger drain. However, the alert service letter still did not remedy the problem; another 560XL airplane, modified in accordance with the alert service letter, sustained ice-bound rudder cables. The manufacturer subsequently issued a mandatory service bulletin that required the installation of a seal and drain to improve water drainage from the stinger. The misdrilled holes on production airplanes were not detected by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) district office assigned to oversee the incident airplane. The manufacturer has subsequently instituted a specific inspection criteria to verify the drain hole installation on production airplanes, and the FAA has verified engineering requirements, planning changes for technicians to follow, and actual holes, including their dimensions.  Probable Cause: The manufacturer's inadequate initial design and subsequent modifications of the tailcone, which allowed moisture to collect and freeze around rudder cables during flight levels above the freezing level and resulted in a loss of rudder authority. Contributing to the accident was the lack of oversight of the manufacturer's design and production by the Federal Aviation Administration."

N63406 was cleared for takeoff on runway 21R and began the takeoff roll. Meanwhile, the Challenger 350 was cleared for takeoff on runway 21L and advised of traffic departing on runway 21R. As the Challenger rotated on runway 21L, N63406 advised of a rough running engine and made a 180 degree turn to land in the opposite direction on runway 21L. The Challenger was issued traffic and reported N63406 in sight. N63406 was then cleared to land runway 21R, but landed on runway 21L. The Challenger pilot later advised of rotating aggressively, pitching the aircraft well above a normal rotation, to gain altitude and overflying N63406 at approximately 200-300 feet.   The FAA rated this a Cat A runway incursion."

        "details": "Shortly after takeoff, a tower air traffic controller notified the flight crew that fuel was pouring from the left wing. The crew also noted hydraulic and flight control annunciator messages and a gear unlocked indication. The flight remained in the traffic pattern and the airplane landed with a fuel imbalance of about 1,000 pounds. An examination of the airplane after the incident revealed minor damage in the left wing and gear well areas. The left main gear aft trunnion pivot pin was not in place, resulting in separation of the aft portion of the left main gear trunnion from the aft trunnion fitting. The end of the aft trunnion punctured the interior of the gear well, resulting in damage to surrounding structure and damage to the fuel cell and hydraulic line. The damage resulted in the fuel leak and the flight control and hydraulic messages. The pin was later found loose and undamaged in the flap track area of the left wing. The aft trunnion pivot pin retaining bolt that was intended to restrain the pivot pin was in place and secured with a nut and cotter pin. A review of maintenance records for the airplane revealed that the left main gear trunnion was removed and replaced with a new unit about six weeks before the incident. The maintenance was performed by an outside vendor. According to the airplane maintenance manual, when installing the aft main landing gear trunnion, the trunnion pivot pin must be slid forward, aligning a hole in the trunnion with a hole in the pivot pin. The trunnion pivot pin is then secured in place with the retaining bolt, washers, nut, and cotter pin. It is likely that the incorrect installation of the left main gear aft trunnion allowed the aft trunnion pivot pin to eventually exit the trunnion and attach fitting. This allowed the aft trunnion to puncture the interior of the gear well.  Probable Cause: The incorrect installation of the left main gear aft trunnion pivot pin by maintenance personnel, which resulted in separation of the aft portion of the left main gear trunnion from the aft trunnion fitting and minor damage to the airplane."

        "details": "Prior to the incident flight, the flight crew performed an uneventful repositioning flight and did not experience any problems with the airplane's landing gear system. During the incident flight, the flight crew was performing a visual approach to the destination airport. The second-in-command (SIC) initiated a landing gear extension, and the landing gear extended but did not lock. The flight crew entered a holding pattern to perform the Landing Gear Down Lock Indication Failure checklist. Before the SIC reached the steps to cycle the landing gear, the flight crew was distracted by a hydraulic overheat condition and diverted to the Hydraulic System Overheat checklist to address that condition. When the SIC returned to the Landing Gear Down Lock Indication Failure checklist, he could not cycle the landing gear per the checklist instructions, because the hydraulic pressure was low. He then began the Emergency Landing Gear Extension checklist. The emergency extension resulted in all three landing gear remaining extended, but only the nosegear locked, and no further pertinent information remained in the checklist. The flight crew then performed an emergency landing at an airport with a longer runway. During the landing, the right main landing gear collapsed, and the airplane came to rest on the runway.   During postaccident examination of the airplane, the landing gear selector handle was found 1/8- to 1/4-inch from the full down position. Subsequent ground testing revealed that when the landing gear selector handle was positioned full up, followed by full down, the landing gear cycled successfully, indicating that, if the flight crew had placed the handle in the full down position, the landing gear would likely have operated normally. When the landing gear selector handle was positioned where it was found, the landing gear extended, but did not lock. A hydraulic bypass also occurred, with a resulting increase in hydraulic fluid temperature and decrease in hydraulic fluid pressure. The hydraulic bypass was most likely the reason that the landing gear did not lock when the emergency gear extension procedure (blow down) was followed during the incident flight. Although, the rigging of the landing gear selector valve arm was found to be 2 degrees beyond specifications, the fact that the landing gear was successfully cycled numerous times with this discrepancy indicates that it was not a contributing factor to this incident. After the incident, the airplane manufacturer revised several checklists by replacing the terms \"normal\" and \"low\" with actual numerical values. Additionally, the Landing Gear Down Lock Indication Failure and Emergency Landing Gear Extension checklists were revised to include more guidance on ensuring that the landing gear handle was positioned full down. Lastly, the Emergency Landing Gear Extension checklist was expanded to include a situation where the blow-down procedure failed to extend and lock all three landing gear.  Probable Cause: The flight crew did not ensure that the landing gear selector handle was in the full down (extend) position. Contributing to the incident was inadequate checklist information."

The flight originated from Fort Myers-Southwest Florida Regional Airport, FL (RSW), at approximately 13:30 EST.The airplane was on initial descent, passing 17,000 feet mean sea level when the flight crew reported hearing a \"bang\" and experienced a slight yawing of the airplane. They believed it was a gear door departing the airplane and reported the event to air traffic control. There were no indications received in the flight deck. The flight crew disconnected the auto-pilot and the airplane \"flew normally.\" The flight continued to Chicago-Midway Airport, IL (MDW) where the airplane landed without incident. A post flight inspection revealed the right engine cowling had departed the airplane and impacted the right horizontal stabilizer."

        "details": "United Parcel Service (UPS) flight 357, a Boeing 767-300, overflew N900QS, a Cessna 750 Citation holding in position on runway 8L at Miami International Airport (MIA), Florida.   The conflict was detected when the tower's airport surface detection equipment, model X (ASDE-X) alarmed. The local controller (LC) instructed UPS357 to go around and turn 10 degrees left. UPS357 was at an altitude of 200 feet and approximately ½ mile from the runway 8L threshold when the crew was told to go-around. UPS357 overflew N900QS by 475 feet. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time.  This loss of required air traffic control separation resulted from the LN/LS controller issuing a landing clearance to UPS357 to a runway occupied by N900QS in position on the same runway. This resulted in UPS357 overflying N900QS by about 475 feet. Contributing to the error was the local controller's noncompliance with traffic advisory procedures, and insufficient requirements for use of memory aids to track arrival and departure operations. When issuing a landing clearance to UPS357, the local controller did not ensure the runway was clear as required by FAA Order 7110.65, Air Traffic Control, paragraph 3-10-3, Same Runway Separation and, the local controller did not advise UPS357 that an aircraft was in position on the landing runway as required by FAA Order 7110.65, paragraph 3-10-5c, Landing Clearance. Contributing to this incident was the lack of required memory aids for arrivals. Miami Air Traffic Control Tower procedures required controllers to use memory aids to indicate that an aircraft had been directed to line up and wait (LUAW), when an aircraft was issued a departure clearance, and to indicate that a runway was occupied by an airport vehicle. However, flight progress strips or memory aids were not required for arrivals and arrival flight progress strips were not used. The data available via the radar presentation on the tower display workstation (TDW) was the only information used for arrival sequencing. While the LUAW memory aide is beneficial to prevent a controller from issuing a takeoff clearance for a runway that is occupied by an aircraft in LUAW position, it did not prevent the controller from issuing a landing clearance to UPS357 nine seconds after he had directed N900QS to LUAW. There were no visual aids utilized to indicate an aircraft was on the runway to which an aircraft had also been cleared to land. According to controller interviews, the \"rule of thumb\" or unofficial procedure for arrivals to a runway occupied by an aircraft in position was that if the arrival reached two miles and the aircraft in position had not started departure roll, the arriving aircraft would be sent around. However, there were no visual clues or memory aids to remind the controller that an aircraft was in position on the runway except where a controller may decide to write down call-signs of arriving aircraft at the control position.  Probable Cause:  The controller's issuance of a landing clearance to an arriving aircraft while another aircraft was in position on the same runway. Contributing to the incident was the controller's non-compliance with traffic advisory procedures, and insufficient requirements for use of memory aids to track arrival and departure operations."

The captain stabilized the airplane and diverted to the nearest airport and landed. Flight data recorder (FDR) data recorded the event that lasted for about 11 seconds. At the time of the turbulence encounter, the airplane was between eight and ten miles in trail of a heavy transport airplane. The transport airplane was level at FL340 and on thesame assigned route as the business jet. The flight crew of the business jet was not aware of the preceding heavy transport after the turbulence encounter.

The Boeing 737-800 was on takeoff roll while N304QS, crossed the runway downfield. The closest proximity between the two airplanes was approximately 2,800 feet when the speed of the Boeing was about 120 knots.   This runway incursion resulted from communications errors. The local control east controller (LE1) misspoke when intending to issue a landing clearance for a flight on approach to runway 35C and instead issued the flight on approacha takeoff clearance from runway 35L. The pilot of AAL2408, already in line up and wait position on runway 35L, interpreted the communication to be a takeoff clearance for his flight, acknowledged the takeoff clearance, and initiated takeoff. Immediately prior to AAL2408 initiating takeoff roll, the LE1 controller had cleared three different aircraft to cross runway 35L on three different taxiways. As AAL2408 began its takeoff roll the Runway Status Lights (RWSLs) on runway 35L activated Activation of the RWSL illuminated the Runway Entrance Lights (RELs) at the hold short locations of the three aircraft that had just been instructed to cross runway 35L and illuminatedthe Takeoff Hold Lights (THLs) at the approach end of the runway. The RELs provided a visual signal to the pilots holding short of runway 35L indicating the runway was unsafe to enter or cross. The THLs provided a visual signal to the pilot of AAL2408 that the runway was occupied however, data indicate that AAL2408 had progressed too far down the runway to observe the THLs by the time they had illuminated. Of the three aircraft holding short of runway 35L, only one proceeded across runway 35L. As that aircraft cleared the runway at taxiway K8 the Airport Surface Detection Equipment, Model-X indicated AAL2408's speed to be 120 knots and the closest proximity between the two aircraft was approximately 2,800 feet. In this incident, the LE1 controlleradjusted his speech rate to the traffic volume while attempting to comply with the requirements of issuing explicit runway crossing clearances for each runway that intersects a taxi route resulting inan excessive speech rate by the LE1. During a System Service Review after the event, controllers identified a recent procedural change that required additional verbiage when issuing crossing instructions, and an increased speech rate associated with increased workload.  Probable Cause: The controller's miscommunication of a clearance and failure to recognize and correct the readback resulting in the flight crew initiating takeoff without a clearance."

        "details": "An Embraer EMB-505 Phenom 300 corporate jet sustained substantial damage in a runway excursion accident at Conroe-Lone Star Executive Airport, Texas.The positioning flight originated from Nashville International Airport, Tennessee, at 07:06 and was bound for Conroe-Lone Star Executive Airport, Texas.ApproachThe pilots planned to land on runway 14, which was assumed to be wet. Before the flight, notices to airmen (NOTAMs) had been issued, which stated that the runway 14 threshold had been displaced 3,377 ft and that the instrument landing system and RNAV instrument approaches were not available. Although the NOTAMs were included in the flight release paperwork, dispatch personnel overlooked them, which resulted in flight planning numbers predicated on the full length of runway 14.During the approach, the pilots listened to the automatic terminal information service information and then became aware that runway 14 was shortened due to construction.Subsequently, the pilots calculated the landing distance required to land on a wet runway and chose to land on runway 1, which was the longer runway. The PIC reported that, during the approach, they encountered light rain but that the rain was moving away from the airport, which alleviated any concern regarding standing water on the runway.LandingThe SIC flew a stabilized approach 9 knots above the reference speed (Vref) and that the airplane touched down 903 ft from the runway threshold at a groundspeed of 118 knots. The SIC stated that he began braking with half pressure and continued to increase the brake pressure to maximum, which was the normal braking procedure, but that the airplane did not appear to be decelerating. The PIC informed the SIC that they needed to slow down, and the SIC replied that he had \"no braking.\" The SIC then applied the emergency parking brake (EPB), but the airplane still did not slow down. FDR data indicated that the airplane achieved its maximum deceleration during the landing roll before the application of the EPB. FDR data showed that, once the SIC applied the EPB, the wheel speed dropped to 0. After determining that there was insufficient runway remaining for a go-around, the pilots realized that the airplane was going to exit the end of the runway. Subsequently, the airplane began to skid along the runway, which resulted in reverted-rubber hydroplaning, thus decreasing the stopping performance, and then exited the departure end of the runway and continued about 400 ft in soft terrain before it impacted a ditch and came to a stop.An examination of the brake system and data downloaded from the brake control unit indicated that the brake system functioned as commanded during the landing. Analysis of the runway surface and the amount of precipitation showed that there should have been no standing water on the runway. Landing distance calculations performed in accordance with the aircraft flight manual (AFM) showed that, even though the SIC exceeded Vref, the airplane should have been able to stop on the available runway. Braking friction According to the National Transportation Safety Board's airplane performance study, the maximum wheel braking friction coefficient achieved during the portion of the ground roll before the application of the EPB was significantly less than the maximum wheel braking coefficient that would have been expected given the unfactored wet-runway landing distances published in the AFM. However, the study determined that, if the EPB had not been engaged and airplane had maintained the braking friction level attained during the landing roll before the engagement of the EPB, it would have been able to stop on the available runway. Therefore, the SIC's application of the EPB, which locked the wheels, reduced the friction level, and decreased the braking performance, prevented the airplane from stopping on the available runway.Nonetheless, the braking friction deficit observed in this accident showed that the stopping performance of the airplane was more consistent with AFM landing distances for runways contaminated with standing water than for runways that were merely \"wet\" even though it was determined that the runway could not have been flooded.Since the accident, the operator has issued a flight operations bulletin instructing pilots to conduct a landing distance assessment using the AFM contaminated runway performance data for the lowest contamination depth when the following three conditions exist: 1) the runway did not have a treated surface, 2) thrust reversers were deferred or not installed, and 3) the airport was reporting rain or heavy rain."

The first officer remembered rotating the door locking handle but could not recall the direction he rotated it. He also could not recall looking at the cabin door lock indicator lights or the cockpit indicator, as was required by the operator's preflight checklist. Just after takeoff, the captain recalled that he heard the cabin door \"leaking\" and the first officer observed that the DOOR SEAL/CABIN DOOR annunciator lights were illuminated. When asked, the first officer did not recall the MASTER CAUTION annunciator illuminating. Had the MASTER CAUTION annunciator illuminated, it would have been one indication that the door was properly secured prior to the takeoff. While on the downwind leg of the traffic pattern during the return for landing, the main cabin door opened. The crew subsequently declared an emergency, and landed uneventfully with the main cabin door open. The airplane incurred minor damage during the landing and the passengers and crew were not injured. Postincident examination of the door and its locking and indicating mechanisms revealed no evidence of any mechanical malfunctions or failures. Because of the close proximity of the amber-colored CABIN DOOR annunciator light and the white-colored GROUND IDLE annunciator light, it is possible that the flight crew inadvertently overlooked the illuminated CABIN DOOR annunciator light prior to takeoff.  Probable Cause: The flight crew's failure to ensure that the cabin door was secured/locked prior to takeoff."

        "details": "The flight departed uneventfully and was climbing to their planned cruise altitude. As the airplane climbed through FL350 at a rate of 1,000 feet per minute (fpm) and with the autopilot engaged, the airplane pitched nose-down and entered a 400-fpm descent. The flight crew then disconnected the autopilot, assumed manual control of the airplane, and leveled at FL350. Both crewmembers noted that \"excessive\" force was required to change the pitch of the airplane, and subsequently notified air traffic control of the situation. The crew then requested a descent, and noted that both trim and manual elevator control inputs would result in an exaggerated pitch response from the airplane. Upon descending through FL180, the crew felt that something \"broke loose\" and the elevator controls began to respond normally. The crew subsequently re-engaged the autopilot and continued to the planned destination uneventfully.     Post-incident examination of the airplane revealed that several of the fuselage bilge drain holes were partially or totally obstructed, allowing water to accumulate within the bilge and in areas adjacent to elevator control cables and pulleys. Several of the pulleys exhibited evidence of saturation with moisture, and two of the pulleys' bearings had seized completely and displayed evidence that the control cable had subsequently worn their grooves. Additionally, seals designed to limit the entry of moisture within the tail area were not trimmed according to the published installation procedure. As a result of the findings of the investigation, the airframe manufacturer and operator each implemented a revised inspection and cleaning program to ensure the proper drainage of moisture from the tailcone and fuselage bilge areas.  Probable Cause: An accumulation of debris in the airplane's bilge drain holes that prevented accumulated moisture from properly draining; the accumulated moisture subsequently froze around the elevator control components, which resulted in the flight control stiffness. Contributing to the accident was maintenance personnel's improper installation of seals in the airplane's tailcone, which allowed water to enter the tailcone."

The airplane was not damaged and the four occupants onboard were not injured.  The flight was operated under 14 CFR Part 91 Subpart K: Fractional.  NTSB determines the probable cause(s) of this incident as follows:  The inoperative galley drain tube heater, which allowed water within the tube to freeze and led to its failure; the tube’s failure allowed water to drain onto the rudder cables and freeze and resulted in the rudder binding during landing."

        "details": "According to the captain, the airplane touched down on runway 25 at 1,000 feet.  Shortly after the nose wheel touched down, the aircraft experienced an uncommanded divergence to the right.  The captain was unable to correct for the divergence.  Approximately 2,800 feet down the runway, skid/scuff marks from the airplane's nose landing gear tires appear as the airplane begins to veer to the right.  Approximately 3,900 feet, the airplane departed the right side of the runway.  The nose landing gear folded aft, and the airplane's nose and right wing tip struck the terrain.  The airplane continued to slide, coming to a stop on the edge of the runway at 4,500 feet.  The airplane's forward fuselage and outboard right wing were substantially damaged.  EGE AWOS reported calm wind.  Several tests of the nose wheel steering servo valve unit revealed that it was commanding a full flow output, resulting in a \"hard over,\" condition.  During the disassembly of the servo valve, a small piece of Teflon lacing tape was located under the torque motor cover seal.  Moisture, rust and a white powdery substance, was observed under the cover, on the torque motor frame, magnets, and in the armature air gaps.  The unit was cleaned, reassembled and installed back on the test stand. A room temperature test and cold soak test was completed.  No further \"hard over\" conditions were detected.  According to Parker, the hard over condition is consistent with the foreign object contamination.  The contamination would permit accumulation of moisture, which could freeze and exert torque on the torque motor armature.  This condition would offset the torque balance and cause the first stage jet to move, commanding the second stage spool into a hard over (P to C2) condition.   Probable Cause: nose wheel steering system failure due to foreign material substance contamination."

The crew had planned a landing on Runway 28, whose southern portion covering its full length was closed owing to repair work. Temporary runway edge lights were placed in the usual runway centreline, and a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) had been published to this effect. One of the tires of the aircraft blew out upon landing when it collided with the temporary runway edge lights. There were no injuries. The aircraft also suffered minor damage to its left and right leading edge flaps."

The airplane came to rest in an upright position and the pilot and copilot were able to exit unassisted.

        "details": "After a flight earlier in the day, the airplane sat on a ramp in moderate rain for about 1 1/2 hours before departing. During the departure, the airplane encountered light to moderate rain, and, while climbing through about 28,000 feet, the crew found that the rudder was frozen in the neutral position. The crew continued the climb to 40,000 feet and, based on discussions with the company, diverted to an en route airport. Descending through 13,000 feet, normal rudder operation returned, and the subsequent approach and landing were uneventful. After the crew disembarked, they noticed water dripping from the belly of the airplane, and subsequently found ice in the bottom of the tailcone stinger, through which the rudder and elevator control cables ran.   About 4 months prior to this incident, two other airplanes had similar incidents that resulted in the manufacturer issuing an alert service letter (ASL). The ASL stated, in part, that the tailcone stinger may not drain water, which could allow ice to form around the rudder cables and pulleys. The ASL required inspection of the two existing drain holes to ensure they were the right size, sealing an existing drain hole, and adding another drain hole in the aft canted bulkhead. This incident airplane had incorporated the ASL prior to the incident.  Subsequent flight testing by the manufacturer revealed that, with the tailcone stinger drain hole sealed per the ASL, air could still enter the tailcone through seams at the bottom of the stinger with enough force to splatter water onto the rudder cables and pulleys, which could then freeze. Testing also revealed that air emanating from the new hole in the aft canted bulkhead also resulted in water splattering onto the rudder cables and pulleys and that, after large quantities of water were introduced, water would only drain forward through the new hole only if large quantities were introduced. As a result, the manufacturer issued a service bulletin, in addition to the ASL (which must be completed) that requires the installation of a seal and another drain.  Probable Cause: The manufacturer's inadequate design fix for previously known tailcone stinger water ingestion and retention."

The captain stated that the flight crew observed the marshaller, who was located on the parking ramp, and continued in the direction of the parking area. Shortly after turning towards the parking ramp, the airplane collided with a ground service vehicle that pulled in front of the airplane. The service vehicle was traveling perpendicular to the airplane's direction of travel. The driver of the service vehicle reported that he was driving on the non-movement service road located adjacent to the taxiway and briefly looked away from the road towards the active runway. When the driver looked back towards the service road, he observed the accident airplane and applied brakes. The ground vehicle stopped in front of the airplane's left wing just before the collision occurred.  At the time of the collision the airplane was transitioning from a movement area to a non-movement area. The service vehicle was operating in a non-movement area and not required to be in contact with air traffic control.  Probable Cause: Failure of the ground service vehicle driver to maintain adequate clearance/distance from the taxiing airplane."

Approximately 3 seconds after touchdown, about the time when the speedbrakes were deployed, the landing gear warning horn began to annunciate and the landing gear retracted. There were no unsafe landing gear configuration warnings prior to touchdown. Extensive testing of the airplane's hydraulic and electrical systems did not reveal any malfunctions that would have resulted in the accident sequence. The landing gear and speedbrake systems were independent; however, wiring from both systems were located on five sets of common connectors. Examination of the wires and connector pins within wiring bundles common to the speedbrake and landing gear system did not reveal any evidence of electrical faults; however, an electrical short could have existed at the time of the accident which would have resulted in a spurious retract signal and would not have been evident in subsequent testing."

        "details": "Spirit Airlines Flight 1818, an Airbus A319-132, N521NK, experienced a fault with both engine integrated drive generators (IDG) while on approach to the Sacramento International Airport (SMF), Sacramento, California.  This incident occurred when a Spirit Airlines Airbus A319 experienced a fault with both engine integrated drive generators (IDG) while on approach to the Sacramento International Airport (SMF), Sacramento, California.  These faults resulted in the loss of electrical power supplied to both electrical networks (AC BUS 1 and AC BUS 2) leading to the loss of several flight deck displays and systems.  Upon the dual loss of power, the ram air turbine (RAT) automatically extended and began driving the emergency generator to provide electrical power to vital services.  The airplane landed without further incident, was towed to the gate and passengers deplaned normally.     A review of the airplane's maintenance records found that the airplane had experienced a similar dual loss of power event during an approach into the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta airport (KALT), Atlanta, Georgia on the previous day.  The airplane had also experienced a similar loss of power on three different occasions on ground while performing single engine taxi after landing in January 2020.  Each engine's IDG was controlled by an independent digital computer called a generator control unit (GCU).  One of its functions was to protect the IDG and its associated electrical network by monitoring and controlling the frequency and voltage output of its respected IDG.  When the GCU detects a fault, it will isolate the IDG from the electrical network, and store the system fault data in its non-volatile memory (NVM).  An amber fault message will also illuminate on the respective generator control push button switch indicating the channel is offline.  Post incident analysis of information from the airplane's GCU revealed that during the incident flight and during the dual loss of power event that occurred on the previous day, both GCU's recorded fault code 145.  This information indicates that the frequency output for both the left and the right engine IDGs were outside of their specified design limits during the incident flight and on the previous day.  Analysis of the data also revealed a similar out of limit frequency output from the left engine IDG when the airplane experienced the three loss of power events in January.  Examination and testing of the left engine IDG revealed that an internal component, a fixed cylinder block, was significantly worn beyond its design limits. Wear was observed in the gold-colored liners assembled inside of the bores of the cylinder block.  The wear was uneven around the circumference and occurred close to either end of the bores, with the heaviest wear extending up from the bottom of the bores. The gold-colored liners were worn through in some areas in several bores, and silver-colored base metal was visible.  The fixed cylinder block and pistons within IDG1 were replaced with serviceable original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts and the IDG was re-tested.  The IDG passed its tests indicating that the wear on the fixed cylinder block and pistons was the reason for the IDG failure during the event flight.  Examination of IDG2 revealed that only one of the cylinder bores of the fixed cylinder block was worn through in a similar fashion to the cylinder block from IDG1.  Although testing of this IDG found that it exhibited a significant frequency modulation on its electrical output, the output was not outside of its specified design limit and therefore would not have triggered a fault code 145 to be recorded on the GCU.  Nevertheless, several tests showed that the fault code 145 was almost triggered under the following test conditions: 1) A constant speed (or a slow sweep profile) between 6,100 RPM and 6,150 RPM, 2) A high IDG load that seems to increase slightly with the modulation amplitude.  Although Spirit Airlines maintenance had performed troubleshooting on the airplane after each of the previous loss of electrical power events, they were unable to determine any faults with the electrical system, including the IDGs.  A review of their maintenance records found that the testing included a run-up of the engines to check electrical loads per their aircraft maintenance manual (AMM), and operational testing of the IDGs.  According to Airbus, the introduction section of their A318/A319/A320/A321 troubleshooting manual (TSM) indicated that if an operator cannot find a fault symptom and/or fault isolation procedure necessary to ensure the continued airworthiness of the aircraft they should contact Airbus.  Airbus indicated that they were not contacted by Spirit Airlines for assistance on these loss of electrical power events.  It is likely that if Spirt Airlines maintenance had contacted Airbus for these loss of electrical power events, they may have identified fault code 145 on the Number 1 GCU and replaced its respective IDG prior to the February 15th event.   As a result of this incident, Airbus has improved their TSM by incorporating steps to direct maintenance towards a direct extraction of the post flight report (PFR) and troubleshooting data (TSD) from the GCUs.  Probable Cause: A worn component within each engine integrated drive generator (IDG) resulted in the loss of electrical power supplied to several flight deck displays and systems while on approach to landing.  The component, a fixed cylinder block, had significant wearing of its reworked brass liners resulting in the IDGs producing a frequency output outside of their specified design limit."

The airplane was equipped with two International Aero Engines (IAE) V2524-A5 turbofan engines. The flight crew reported that about ten minutes after takeoff, at FL190, the electronic centralized aircraft monitor (ECAM) displayed a No. 1 engine pressure ratio (EPR) mode fault, N2 over limit warning, and an exhaust gas temperature (EGT) over limit warning. The ECAM notifications coincided with heavy vibrations that could be felt throughout the cockpit and cabin. Both engines were advanced to the take-off/go around (TO/GA) power setting until a No. 1 engine fire warning registered about four minutes later at which time the flight crew shutdown the No. 1 engine and discharged one fire suppression bottle. During the event sequence smoke began entering the cockpit and the crew donned oxygen masks. The airplane returned to DFW and executed an uneventful single engine landing. Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) personnel met the aircraft on the runway and determined the fire had been extinguished.   Based onmetallurgical analysis,a No. 1 enginehigh pressure turbine (HPT) 2nd stageblade separatedbelow the blade platform due tostress corrosion cracking in the blade J-channel cooling air cavity.The liberated bladeentered the gas path and caused extensive damage to the HPT and low pressure turbine (LPT) hardware and cases. The damaged engine was left at a high power setting for about four minutes until the crew received a No. 1 engine fire warning. During this time the turbine was exposed to temperatures that exceeded the material annealing temperature and resulted in failure and separation of multiple components including the LPT 3rd and 4th stage disks, turbine exhaust case center body, and the No. 5 bearing housing. The engine nacelle was not breached and all separated engine components traveled out the back of the engine.  Probable Cause: A high pressure turbine 2nd stage blade separation due to stress corrosion cracking in the J channel cooling cavity. The failed blade entered the gas path and caused substantial damage to the low pressure turbine. The engine was subsequently left at a high power setting for approximately four minutes, exposing the turbine hardware to temperatures that exceeded the material annealing temperature and resulted in in failure and separation of multiple engine components."

The pilots were not injured. According to the captain, he and the first officer planned for the flight into NC06 the day before the accident. They reviewed forecasted weather and landing performance data for landing on both a dry and wet runway. They also reviewed the airport video and manual. The captain said as they were en route to NC06 the following day, he and the first officer observed a small rain cell in the vicinity of the airport. They briefed that if they could not make the visual approach they would divert to another airport or hold until the weather passed. However, as they approached the airport, the captain made visual contact with the runway and began the visual approach into the airport using the visual cues recommended in the airport video. The airport was reporting calm winds and light rain. The captain said he flew the entire recommended VFR approach and was fully configured to land and slowing to Vref speed when they were on a 1-mile final. They also capture the visual approach slope indicator (VASI) lights and proceeded to land. The captain said to the NTSB, \"As soon we touched down I applied full brakes only to find the brakes were not slowing the airplane, by the time we realized the plane was not slowing it started to drift right and went off the runway slightly on the right side of the runway ... I see the cliff off the end of the runway and apply full left rudder and steering to the left to try and steer toward extra terrain on the left to avoid going of the cliff, as we go thru the small taxiway and into the other grass area, we took a sign with our wing. As we are still moving forward, we hit a beige Jeep on our wing tip which actually caused us to stop and saved our lives by not allowing us to go off the cliff 5 feet in front of us.\"Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed substantial damage to the left wing."

        "details": "Northwest Airlines flight 188, an Airbus A320, N374NW, did not communicate with air traffic control (ATC) for approximately 1 hour 17 minutes. While the flight was NORDO (no radio communications), it flew past its intended destination at cruise altitude of 37,000 feet but landed without further incident after radio communication was reestablished. There were no injuries to the 2 pilots, 3 flight attendants, and 144 passengers onboard.  The airplane departed San Diego International Airport, CA (SAN) about 16:59 central daylight time.   The flight progressed normally until about 18:56:41, when the Denver Center controller wanted to transfer the flight to the next sector and radioed, “...one eighty eight contact Denver center, one three two point one seven.” At 18:56:56, the controller again directed NWA188 to “contact Denver center, one three two point one seven.” At 18:57:01, NWA188 responded, “okay three two one seven, northwest one eighty eight.” This was the last ATC communication from NWA188 while in Denver center airspace.   NWA188 entered the next Denver sector’s airspace but did not check in on the assigned frequency. The controller of this sector at 19:05:31, directed NWA188 to “contact Denver center” on frequency 127.02, the radio frequency for the fourth Denver sector. Twentyone seconds later, the controller again directed NWA188 to change frequency.  NWA188 entered the fourth Denver sector’s airspace and did not check in on the assigned frequency. The flight continued without radio contact and subsequently entered the fifth Denver sector’s airspace.  About 1924:16, the fifth Denver controller completed an AIT to Minneapolis ARTCC and directed NWA188 to “contact Minneapolis center” on frequency 124.87. Nine seconds later, the controller repeated the request for a frequency change. At 1924:32, the fifth Denver controller called NWA188 for a radio check and received no response. The fifth Denver controller then called the first Minneapolis controller , to inquire if NWA188 had checked in. The Denver controller was advised that the flight crew had not checked in on the assigned frequency. The Denver controller then told the Minneapolis controller that he would “go find him.” At 1924:55, the fifth Denver controller called the fourth Denver controller and asked that controller to try to contact NWA188. At 1925:14, the fourth Denver controller made a single radio transmission to NWA188, asking the flight crew to contact Denver ARTCC on frequency 126.32. At 1926:07, the fifth Denver controller contacted the Denver area 5 front line manager (FLM) and requested that the manager contact NWA company dispatch, ask them to contact   NWA188, and direct the NWA188 pilots to contact Minneapolis center on frequency 124.87. The fifth Denver controller then advised the first Minneapolis controller that Denver ARTCC was contacting NWA dispatch and that NWA188 should be back on the frequency in a few minutes. At 1930:36 and 1936:42, the first Minneapolis controller attempted to contact NWA188.  About 1932 and 1934, NWA dispatch sent NWA188 aircraft communication addressing and reporting system (ACARS) messages requesting that the flight contact ARTCC. At 1938:15, the first Minneapolis controller advised the next Minneapolis controller that NWA188 was NORDO and executed an AIT. The first Minneapolis controller then directed NWA188 to “contact Minneapolis center” on frequency 119.87. At 1939:45, the second Minneapolis controller attempted to contact NWA188. At 1939:55, the second Minneapolis controller asked another NWA aircraft, NWA196, to attempt to contact NWA188 on that sector’s frequency of 119.87. At 1942:11, NWA196 advised ATC that they had also requested that NWA dispatch ask NWA188 to come up on frequency 119.87. About 1944, two ACARS messages were sent to NWA188 from NWA dispatch requesting that the pilots contact ARTCC. At 1946:56, the second Minneapolis controller attempted to contact NWA188. At 1948:17, the second Minneapolis controller radioed, “northwest one eighty eight uh if you hear Minneapolis center ident.” No ident was observed. At 1951:56, the controller again attempted to contact NWA188. In between the transmissions to NWA188, the second Minneapolis controller coordinated with controllers from other sectors to advise that NWA188 was NORDO and scheduled to land at MSP. The third Minneapolis controller advised the second controller that he would attempt to contact NWA188 on frequency 121.5. At 1956:40, the third Minneapolis controller transmitted on 121.5 MHz for NWA188, “contact Minneapolis center” on frequency 119.87. About 1957, another ACARS message was sent to NWA188 from NWA dispatch. FDR data indicate that, about 2001, the flight mode annunciator (FMA) on the pilots’ primary flight display (PFD) reverted from navigation mode to heading mode. At 2003:02, the second Minneapolis controller coordinated with and transferred control of NWA188 to the fourth controller.  About 2007, 2008, and 2011, ACARS messages were sent to NWA188 from NWA dispatch. At 2007:41 and 2012:47, the fourth Minneapolis controller attempted to contact NWA188. At 2012:46, NWA188 transmitted on frequency 132.125 and advised that they had overflown their destination and needed to turn around and head for Minneapolis. Although the pilots did not know it at the time, the frequency they used was for Winnipeg Area Control Center (YWG), Thunder Bay Low Sector. After establishing NWA188’s position over Eau Claire, Wisconsin, at FL370, the YWG controller advised NWA188 that it was on the wrong frequency and directed the pilots to contact Minneapolis center on frequency 123.72. At 2013:02, the fifth Minneapolis controller requested another NWA airplane to attempt to contact NWA188 on frequency 126.23. At 2014:06, NWA188 established communications with the fifth Minneapolis controller on frequency 123.72. At 2014:14, NWA188 radioed, “roger, we got distracted and we’ve overflown Minneapolis. We’re overhead Eau Claire and would like to make a one eighty and do arrival from Eau Claire.” NWA188 was then given radar vectors to begin arrival into MSP. During the descent, Minneapolis ARTCC controllers queried NWA188 several times concerning the cause of the NORDO. Each time, the pilots indicated that they had “cockpit distractions.”    Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be: The flight crew's failure to monitor the airplane’s radio and instruments and the progress of the flight after becoming distracted by conversations and activities unrelated to the operation of the flight."

        "details": "A Cessna 208B airplane, N169LJ, sustained substantial damage during a forced landing shortly after takeoff from the Mekoryuk Airport, Alaska. Of the nine people aboard, the two pilots and six passengers were not injured, and one passenger sustained minor injuries. The airplane was being operated as Era Alaska Flight 140 to Bethel, Alaska.The pilot-in-command (PIC) stated that the second-in-command (SIC) was the flying pilot for the flight to Bethel. He said that the takeoff and initial climb were normal, but shortly after passing 1,000 feet, the engine \"coughed,\" started vibrating, and lost power. An attempt to restart the engine was not successful. The PIC assumed control of the airplane, and landed on a frozen bay approximately 5 miles northeast of the Mekoryuk Airport. Witnesses at the airport observed the airplane descending, and responded with snow machines, and all-terrain vehicles to transport the airplane's occupants back to Mekoryuk. During the forced landing the airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and right wing.A postaccident engine examination, performed at the facilities of Pratt & Whitney Canada, St. Hubert, Quebec, Canada, and under the direction of a senior NTSB powerplants investigator, revealed that a blade on the first stage compressor rotor failed as a result of a fatigue fracture. The fatigue crack initiated from the leading edge area and then propagated towards the trailing edge, and at mid-chord, the blade released by tensile overload. The initiation of the fracture could not be determined because of secondary damage to the fracture surface."

He also reported that he based his flight planning on flying at 105 knots (120 mph); however, he used a higher power setting and the airplane cruised at 120 knots (138 mph).  On the last leg, as the pilot neared his destination airport, the engine lost power and he performed an off-airport, forced landing.  The pilot lost airspeed as he cleared a line of trees.  He then lowered the nose, and when he tried to flare, the nose would not come up.  The airplane struck the ground in a nose-low attitude, and the nosewheel \"drove\" into the soft terrain.  The pilot reported that the power loss was due to fuel exhaustion.  The pilot also reported that he did not verify the fuel quantity onboard the airplane prior to his last departure.  A check of the pilot's route revealed that he flew near two airports where he could have landed and refueled prior to experiencing fuel exhaustion.  Probable Cause: The pilot's improper fuel consumption calculations, which resulted in fuel exhaustion.  A factor was the unsuitable terrain."

He stated that after refueling, he departed for a second flight and after 20 minutes, he prepared to land. On an extended downwind leg, at 1,100 feet above ground level (AGL) and about to turn base leg, he encountered some turbulence. He increased power and got out of it, only to enter turbulence again. The airplane went into a dive and went inverted, cutting the fuel flow off to the engine. He was able to regain control and fly the airplane. However, without engine power he was gliding toward the woods. The airplane was too close to the trees, and the pilot's only option was to reduce airspeed to near stalling and mush down on the treetops. The airplane descendedinto the trees with the left wingtip on the ground and the nose 6 feet off the ground. The reported wind, at an airport about 12 miles northwest of the accident site, about the time of the accident, was from 250 degrees at 9 knots. Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane following an in-flight encounter with turbulence during approach, which led to a loss of engine power due to fuel starvation, and subsequent forced landing into trees."

        "details": "The pilot was conducting a postmaintenance flight. Shortly after liftoff and while the airplane was in a climbing left turn, the airplane lost total engine power. The pilot reported that, about 7seconds after liftoff he heard the engine 'splutterâ€ as it decelerated from takeoff power toward idle. He pushed the control stick forward to reduce the airplane's angle of attack, but the airplane impacted terrain in a nose-down attitude. One witness reported that, after the loss of engine power, the airplane's left wing dropped, and the airplane entered an aerodynamic spin that continued about one-half of a rotation before the airplane impacted the ground. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the forward fuselage and engine mount during impact.  A postaccident engine examination revealed no evidence of a mechanical failure that would have resulted in the total loss of engine power. The airplane's fuel tank cap had a cracked rubber seal that had hardened from age, and the fuel cap vent holes were small and partially obstructed by the seal. An inadequately vented fuel cap could have resulted in a negative pressure within the fuel tank and fuel starvation to the engine. Additionally, the carburetor heat flexible hose was found disconnected from the carburetor, and there was no attachment hardware present. The weather conditions at the time and location of the accident were conducive to a serious accumulation of carburetor icing with the engine at glide (descent) power.  On the basis of the available evidence, the investigation was unable to determine whether inadequate fuel tank venting or carburetor icing caused the total loss of engine power. However, after the loss of engine power, the pilot likely exceeded the airplane's critical angle of attack, and the airplane subsequently entered an aerodynamic stall and spin from which recovery was not possible due to the airplane's low altitude.  Probable Cause: The total loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined with the available evidence and the pilot's exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack, which led to an aerodynamic stall and spin at a low altitude."

In a subsequent written report, the pilot reported that the aircraft's right main wheel brake locked up during the landing roll.  He also reported that he was landing with a tailwind.  Runway 18 is serviced by a 2-box, 3 degree VASI.  Probable Cause: The pilot's misjudgment of distance while landing, which resulted in a runway overrun.  Factors include rough uneven terrain and a tailwind."

The FAA flight service stations had been promulgating \"Airmet Sierra\" warning of low ceilings and mountain obscurations for the Franklin/Waynesville area from 2000 of the night of September 6, 2000, to 1000 of the morning of September 7. The flight followed highway 23/74 to Sylva, continuing toward Waynesville's Haywood County Mountain Research Station where the rotorcraft, its onboard fire fighting equipment, and crew were to serve as a static display for school children. About 5 minutes out, the pilot radioed the Haywood County Forest Ranger who had the landing zone secured for his arrival that he would put the rotorcraft down and wait for unexpected fog to lift. Residents in West Waynesville saw and heard the rotorcraft try to pick its way in very heavy ground fog. The rotorcraft collided with trees in mountainous terrain south of West Waynesville at the 4,400-foot level. Examination at the crash site and factory examinations of the engine and rotor mast revealed no precrash mechanical malfunctions. Use of over-the-counter pharmaceutical compounds of cold and allergy medicines were found in toxicological testing of specimens of the pilot. Probable Cause: An in-flight encounter with ground level fog due to the pilot's decision to continue VMC flight into instrument conditions, resulting in an in-flight collision with trees."

He then reduced the throttle.  He said, '...I think I was already in trouble when I began the auto rotation from such a low altitude...[and] I also don't thing that I had the collective all the way down because...the rotor rpms apparently began to bleed down without my noticing it...at about 50 feet agl I flared...then leveled and started pulling collective.  The helicopter started violently shaking...which...indicates that the rotors were trying to stall from too low rpms...I couldn't stop my decent...I don't think I powered back up with the throttle...I hit the ground fairly violently...the helicopter...roll[ed] onto its left side...and the helicopter finally came to a stop about 30 yards from the point of initial impact.' Examination of the wreckage revealed no mechanical discrepancies.  According the FAA's report, the pilot '...failed to perform the autorotation correctly and impacted the earth.'  Probable Cause: the pilot's failure to maintain control of the helicopter during a practice autorotation, by allowing the rotor rpm to become inadequate to cushion the touchdown, which resulted in a hard landing, and subsequent roll over."

After taking off without incident, the flight crew started running the after takeoff checklist and the pilot moved the landing gear selector handle to the up position. The crew then felt and heard a loud \"clank\" in the nose of the airplane and observed that the red or unsafe nose gear light had illuminated; recycling the landing gear handle had the same result. As the flight crew returned to the departure airport, they selected the landing gear handle to the down position and received three green landing gear down indications and completed the before landing checklist; the air traffic controller advised that the nose landing gear appeared to be straight. During the landing, the airplane touched down on the main wheels first, but once the nosewheel touched down and weight was on the nose landing gear, the airplane suddenly turned sharply 30° to 40° to the left and application of right rudderdid not counter the turn. The airplane then partially traveled off the left side of the runway pavement, its left main landing gear struck a concrete runway edge-light base, then the airplane turned about 180° from its original direction of travel and came to rest on the left side of the runway about 1,500 ft from the end of the runway."

        "details": "The airplane was on a positioning flight when it sustained substantial damage on impact with trees during a forced landing after a loss of engine power in cruise flight.  The pilot reported that he had finished spraying the last field at 1715 and the left fuel gage showed 1/2 tank (14 gallons) of fuel remaining and the right tank was dry.  The pilot reported the airplane consumed about 14 gallons of fuel per hour, and that he thought he had about 45-60 minutes of fuel remaining when he departed the field.  The pilot reported that the engine quit while in cruise flight, and he excuted a forced landing and impacted trees at approximately 1745.  The fuel system was inspected during the recovery of the airplane.  The right fuel tank was dry.  The left wing tank had a ruptured fuel line.  The inspection revealed there was no fuel found from the fuel line to the engine driven fuel pump.  No fuel was found from the engine driven fuel pump to the mixing valve/fuel control.  No fuel was found in the line from the fuel control to the fuel distributor/spider.        Probable Cause: Fuel exhaustion due to the pilot's improper fuel calculations.  Contributing factors to the accident included the inaccurate fuel gage and the trees."

        "details": "On June 17, 2023, about 1059 central daylight time (CDT), a Gulfstream G-IV, N926TT, operated by Planet 9 Private Air, LLC., experienced an uncontained No. 2 (right) engine failure shortly after beginning a step climb at FL400. The flight crew secured the No. 2 engine, declared an emergency, and diverted the airplane to Sioux Gateway Airport (SUX), Sioux City, Iowa where they made an uneventful single engine landing. There were no injuries reported. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 flight from Philadelphia International Airport (PHL), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Charles M. Schulz Sonoma County Airport (STS), Santa Rosa, California.   According to the flight crew, they had been approved to climb from FL400 to FL430 and moments after pressing flight level change (FLCH), they experienced massive vibrations, and a subsequent No. 2 engine rollback.    A visual inspection of the No. 2 engine inlet and nacelle were performed after landing at SUX. One fan blade was separated at the midspan, and all fan blades exhibited leading edge impact damage. There was a hole in the engine nacelle forward of the fan plane of rotation at approximately the 1 o’clock position.    The airplane was quarantined at SUX for additional engine and nacelle examination. The recorders will be downloaded at the NTSB Headquarters in Washington, DC. The engine will be retained for teardown examination. In accordance with ICAO Annex 13 guidelines, the German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation (BFU) and the United Kingdom Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) assigned Accredited Representatives as the state of manufacture and design of the engines to assist with the investigation. Additional parties to the investigation include the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Gulfstream Aerospace, and Rolls-Royce as a Technical Advisor to German BFU."

After receiving a weather report with no notation of adverse conditions, the pilot launched the balloon for a pleasure flight in the desert landscape.  After several hours he opted to touchdown below a ridge located next to a road.  After the basket contacted the surface, a gust of wind dragged the balloon over the ridge, resulting in substantial damage to the foot well and broomstick; the pilot sustained a broken ankle.  The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the balloon.  Probable Cause: the pilot's encounter with a wind gust during landing."

        "details": "The instructor and the student pilot departed on a training flight with the intention of practicing off airport landings. The instructor maneuvered the helicopter towards a plateau with cliffs on three of its sides, and initiated a demonstration of a pinnacle landing. He then noticed the development of an excessive sink rate and wind change and attempted to correct with collective and throttle. Shortly thereafter, he reached the stop on the throttle and the RPM began decaying. The instructor lowered collective and the rotorcraft impacted the ground hard bouncing back into the air 10-12 feet before striking the ground a second time, during which the tail rotor impacted the ground. Directional control was lost and the rotorcraft rolled over the edge of the plateau and down a steeply sloped embankment. The instructor pilot had logged only 3 hours of flight time, all in the accident aircraft make within the previous 90 days. A weather observation recorded at the Caldwell airport 11 nm south of the accident site reported winds from 110 degrees at 9 knots with gusts to 14 knots. The instructor pilot reported that there was no mechanical malfunction with the rotorcraft during the flight.  CAUSE: The instructor pilot's failure to maintain the proper rate of descent on landing. Factors were a sudden wind shift, the instructor pilot's lack of recent experience, and terrain drop-off."

        "details": "The non-instrument rated pilot and passenger were returning to their home airport. Due to localized weather, instrument meteorological conditions prevailed over and in the vicinity of the airport.  Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) data recorded the airplane maneuver around the airport multiple times including one approach to the runway. During the airplane’s last approach toward the runway, the airplane made a 180° right turn about 1/4 mile southeast of the runway and then descend. The last ADS-B point recorded the airplane in a right descending turn, about 1,000 ft agl. Witnesses on the ground saw the airplane in a vertical nose-low attitude with a loud engine noise, as the airplane descended and impacted the ground.  A review of weather information found an overcast ceiling about 1,500 ft agl with cloud tops near 3,500 ft mean sea level (msl) and the potential for moderate turbulence below 3,000 ft msl. There was no evidence that the pilot received a weather briefing before the flight. The airport was closed 44 days before the accident and a Notice to Airman was published and available. In addition, the automated weather reporting facility was turned off and not broadcasting weather information. Investigators did not determine if the pilot was aware that the airport was closed.  The airplane’s impact drove the airplane deep into the ground. Due to impact damage and distortion, a detailed examination of the wreckage could not be accomplished. Of the portions examined, no anomalies were detected with the airframe and engine which would have precluded normal operation of the airplane.  Toxicology detected the diphenhydramine, ethanol, and n-propanol in putrefied samples. The diphenhydramine level was below the therapeutic range and likely did not contribute to the accident. Ethanol and n-propanol were likely produced postmortem.  The circumstances of the accident are consistent with the non-instrument rated pilot’s intentional flight into instrument meteorological conditions (clouds) which resulted in spatial disorientation and an inflight loss of control.  Probable Cause: The non-instrument rated pilot’s intentional flight into instrument meteorological conditions (clouds) which resulted in spatial disorientation and an inflight loss of control."

        "details": "About 3 minutes into the positioning flight, at 3,000 feet, the flight crew heard a \"loud bang\" and became aware that the main passenger door had separated from the airplane. The pilot declared an emergency, diverted to a nearby airport, and landed without further incident. The separated passenger door was subsequently found on a nearby golf course.  The co-pilot reported in a written statement that he closed the main passenger door and checked for a green light to ensure that it was secure. In a subsequent interview, he reported that he \"believed\" that the door warning lights were working, but he could not positively recall seeing the \"Door Safe\" light illuminated after closing the door. He also did not remember activating the \"Recall\" switch before takeoff.  Ramp security video showed that the main passenger door appeared to close; it then re-opened momentarily and closed again before the airplane taxied out of the ramp area. The co-pilot reported that he re-closed the door because it did not secure on the first attempt. An examination of the recovered door and the door frame did not reveal evidence of a pre-existing mechanical malfunction or failure that would have precluded normal operation. The top half of the door was crushed from the impact with the ground, which prevented establishing the condition of door rigging before the accident. An examination of the fuselage revealed a skin puncture that matched the location of the door pull-out handle and is consistent with the door being in the open position when the puncture occurred. Although the door's external handle was found in the closed position, smudging on the fuselage was consistent with the handle's movement from the open to the closed position during impact with the fuselage.  Although it is apparent from the cockpit voice recording that the flight crew referenced the pilot checklist at some stages during ground operations, crew challenge and response items were sporadically mentioned. After the sound of the passenger door closing, neither crewmember mentioned the door warning lights. At no point during ground operations through the takeoff sequence were the doors, door warning lights, or master caution system mentioned. The co-pilot mentioned the \"Annunciator\" check in the Before Takeoff checklist; however, no \"Recall\" response was noted on the recording. Activating the recall switch would have alerted the flight crew to an unsecured door before takeoff."

The airport elevation was 828 feet mean sea level (msl). Radar data showed the airplane climbed to an altitude of 1,500 ft mean sea level (msl), before initiating a right-hand turn as the pilot had been instructed. The pilot's communications with air traffic control were routine until he failed to acknowledge the controller's instruction to continue the turn and to climb to 5,000 ft msl. Radar data showed that the airplane climbed to 2,300 ft msl, turned left, and started to descend. Radar contact was lost after the plane descended below 2,200 ft msl. The airplane struck trees 3.5 miles south of the airport at an elevation of 850 ft msl, and was in a left wing low 50 degree nose down pitch attitude during the impact sequence. A postaccident examination of the airplane and engine revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal operation, and the propeller showed impact damage consistent with operating at high power. Based on the observed weather in the area, the pilot would have been in IMC shortly after initiating his right-hand turn. The IMC flight conditions, radar track, power settings, and impact attitude are consistent with the pilot experiencing spatial disorientation. Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane due to spatial disorientation."

The airline transport rated pilot was seriously injured, one passenger sustained minor injuries, and two other passengers were not injured.  The airplane was operated as a business flight by High Tech Inc., of Dallas, Texas, under Title 14 CFR Part 91.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local flight for which a flight plan was not filed.  According to the law enforcement officer who interviewed the pilot at the hospital, the aircraft departed from a grass airstrip at the Hickory Bluff Ranch near Llano, Texas, for a local flight around the ranch.  Several workers at the ranch witnessed the airplane \"attempting to climb in the direction of rising terrain without gaining altitude.\"   In a telephone interview conducted by the investigator in charge, and in enclosed NTSB Form 6120.1/2, the pilot stated that he selected a 30 degree flap setting as called for a short field takeoff.  During the takeoff roll the engine sounded \"normal\" and the airplane broke ground prior to reaching mid field and a climb attitude was established.  The pilot added that as the airplane climbed to about 100 feet above the ground, the \"climb went from positive to approximately level,\" attitude as he approached rising terrain.  The pilot further stated that he elected to retract the flaps to a 20 degree setting to \"improve on the climb performance\" by reducing drag.  The pilot attempted to maintain controlled flight and \"flew around the larger trees looking for an open area\" but the \"rising terrain towards the ridge made it impossible to avoid contact.\"  Control was lost as the pilot \"pulled the joke back\" and slowed the airplane prior to impact with the trees.   The airplane came to rest approximately a 1/2 mile from the point of departure and a post-impact fire destroyed the airplane.  The pilot and the front seat passenger of the airplane told a law enforcement officer that the engine \"was operating normally during the flight.\"   On the enclosed Pilot/Operator Report, the pilot stated that a 10 to 20 knot headwind prevailed at the time of his departure from the 2,600 foot airstrip.  During the telephonic interview with the investigator in charge, the pilot attributed the deterioration in climb performance to a downdraft \"created by orographic effect of the wind blowing over the ridgeline.\" PROBABLE CAUSE:THE PILOT'S ENCOUNTER WITH A DOWNDRAFT AND HIS INABILITY TO OUTCLIMB RISING TERRAIN. FACTORS WERE THE RISING TERRAIN AND HIGH WINDS."

While proceeding to PTY they were notified by ATC that Panamá Pacífico Airport (BLB) was in visual conditions, which made them change the decision and proceed to BLB and were authorized to RNAV approach to runway 36.During the approach, ATC radioed that PAC had resumed operations and was open, so the crew decided to proceed to PAC since it was the initial destination airport. The crew was assigned a visual approach to runway 01 for which the crew requested a long approach, which was performed at night with drizzle.On short final an indication appeared on the EICAS showing 'steer by wire Fail'. The captain proceeded to reconfigure the nose wheel steering. The aircraft descended below the glide path and the first Officer warned the captain about four red lights of the PAPI. When adding power, a sound was heard, but the aircraft landed normally. Upon arrival at the hangar, serious damage was observed on the left-hand wing leading edge and flaps. It appeared the aircraft had struck light poles."

The pilot looked to the left and observed the left wing displaced 20 degrees up from its normal position.  The glider began to descend and control inputs by the pilot were unresponsive.  In the decent, as the glider's speed began to increase, the pilot elected to egress from the glider.  The glider broke apart in flight and descended to the ground.  A piece of the glider's fiberglass skin that contained a residue of an adhesive on the inside surface was removed and examined.  The adhesive area would have attached spar pin-lock assembly, which secured the wing spar pins. The surface of this epoxy layer contained impression marks similar to a cross-weave pattern found on the surface of fiberglass. The cross-weave pattern on the surface of the epoxy was consistent with a fracture that traveled between the UD-glass fabric tape and the epoxy layer.  This separation was characterized as an adhesive separation.  The surface of the epoxy layer also contained exposed voids.  No bonding between the epoxy and UD-glass fabric tape was observed in the void areas.  Probable Cause: The manufacturer's use of inadequate adhesive material which resulted in the de-bonding and subsequent failure of the wing spar pin-lock assembly."

The airplane was in cruise flight at 11,000 feet agl, 29 miles east of Cross City Airport in Florida, when suddenly with no warning or spool down time, the engine failed. The engine's gauges instantly went to zero. Upon the engine failure, the pilot declared an emergency with air traffic control and was advised that the closest airport was the Cross City Airport on a heading of 080 and 29 miles away. He turned the airplane toward the airport and went through the engine out procedures. The attempts to restart the engine were unsuccessful. He had the aircraft set up for best glide speed; the glide was approximately 22 miles. When the airplane was about 300 feet agl, he opened the crew door and latched it open. He slowed the airplane to just above stall speed before impacting the trees. Upon contact with the trees, he pulled back on the yoke and stalled the airplane into the trees. He was able to exit the airplane without assistance. The airplane came to rest 8.2 miles east of the Cross City Airport."

        "details": "The purpose of the flight was to transport two company employees to an island located 22 miles offshore.  The pilot was not instrument rated.  The weather conditions along the coast consisted of overcast skies with cloud bases from 700 to 1,100 feet, and, tops between 1,900 and 2,200 feet; visibilities were generally in the 4- to 5-mile range.  Ground and pilot witnesses said that a localized area of lower cloud bases, between 350 and 500 feet, and reduced visibilities of about 1.5 miles existed in the area of the accident site.  Review of recorded radar data disclosed that the helicopter descended from a cruise altitude of 900 feet and crossed the shoreline at 400 feet.  As the helicopter reached the accident site location, it climbed to 600 feet over 19 seconds, then turned right to a northerly heading while the altitude climbed from 600 to 900 feet; the radius of turn was calculated at 720 feet at an average ground speed of 69 knots.  The helicopter then descended to 700 feet as the radar track began a wide left turn, which then reversed to a tight right turn.  The last four radar returns showed a right turn with a 120-foot radius, with a constant Mode C report of 700 feet; the average computed ground speed during this turn was 67 knots. The last radar return was a secondary beacon without a Mode C altitude report; the location of the last radar return was about 200 feet from where the wreckage was found on the ocean floor.  No preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures were found during examination of the wreckage.  Probable Cause: The pilot's in-flight loss of control due to spatial disorientation while maneuvering to reverse direction after an inadvertent encounter with instrument meteorological conditions."

The private pilot was not injured. The aircraft was destroyed. The aircraft was operated by Aviation Training Associates of Sanford, Florida. The flight was conducted under 14 CFR Part 91. Night, visual meteorological conditions existed at the time, and a visual flight rules flight plan was filed for the personal flight to Knoxville, Tennessee. The flight originated in Sanford, Florida, at 1945 on November 19, 1993.       The pilot reported the following: He was descending to land at McGhee-Tyson Airport in Knoxville when the engine quit. He had run extra long on the right fuel tank to keep the left tank as full as possible for landing. He switched to the left tank, but had trouble generating full power. The right tank fuel quantity gauge indicated zero gallons, and the left tank gauge indicated 6 gallons remaining. After rocking the wings, the engine started momentarily, then quit again. Unable to maintain engine power, he force landed the airplane about 3 miles to the east of the McGhee-Tyson Airport.        The aircraft came to rest on the edge of a road, on top of downed power lines. The left wing was separated from, and adjacent to, the main wreckage. Personnel from the Blount County Fire Department reported that there was no evidence of spilled fuel at the accident site. A wrecker service operator recovered the wreckage shortly after the accident. He reported that the severed left wing was found about 10 feet from the main wreckage, and the fuel tank was ruptured. There was no fuel inside the tank, and no evidence of fuel spillage on the ground. The right wing was still attached to the fuselage. There was no evidence of fuel in the right fuel tank, and it was ruptured. There was no evidence of spilled fuel under the right wing. The wrecker service operator reported that he smelled no fuel fumes anywhere at the accident site.       The pilot reported no mechanical problems with the aircraft. According to Federal Aviation Administration records, the aircraft was flown approximately 5.7 hours during the accident flight. The pilot reported that he began the flight with 50 gallons of fuel on board. According to the pilot's operating handbook for this aircraft, the fuel consumption at 75 percent (cruise power) is 8.4 gallons per hour.  PROBABLE CAUSE:THE PILOT'S INADEQUATE INFLIGHT PLANNING, WHICH RESULTED IN FUEL EXHAUSTION PRIOR TO REACHING THE PLANNED DESTINATION."

        "details": "The 76-year-old commercial pilot was making a personal cross-country flight in the airplane. Video from the departure airport's security camera showed the airplane taking off about 38 minutes before sunrise. Shortly thereafter, a witness 4 miles southeast of the airport reported hearing the airplane fly over at a low altitude followed by the sound of impact.  The ground scars and wreckage distribution at the accident site indicated that the airplane likely impacted terrain in a near straight-and-level attitude and at an airspeed within the normal flight envelope, suggesting that the airplane was under control at the time of impact. During examination of the airframe and engine, no anomalies were found that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane.  The pilot's autopsy revealed that he had severe coronary artery disease but no evidence of an old or new heart attack. An acute cardiac event would leave no evidence on autopsy; however, given the indications that this was controlled flight into terrain, it is unlikely that the pilot's coronary artery disease contributed to the circumstances of the accident.  The pilot's toxicology findings included two potentially-impairing sedating antihistamines, chlorpheniramine and diphenhydramine. However, due to limited specimens, blood drug levels were not available, and the investigation was unable to determine whether the sedating antihistamines or the conditions being treated by the medications contributed to the circumstances of the accident. Finally, the pilot had recently been diagnosed with early dementia of the Alzheimer's type, and the cognitive and visuospatial deficits resulting from this disease likely impaired his ability to safely control the airplane. However, the investigation was unable to determine if the cognitive impairment directly contributed to the accident.  Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from terrain."

After touchdown, he applied brakes and the airplane veered left. He pressed harder on the right brake pedal, but the plane did not react, so he applied full right pedal but he did not observe any response. The airplane skidded off the left side of the runway and continued skidding through grass. It subsequently struck a small embankment at the edge of a cotton field, where it came to rest upright. The pilot added that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions with the airplane. Examination of the wreckage by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed substantial damage to the right wing, nose landing gear, and firewall. His examination, which also included observing the airplane's left main wheel was free to rotate and that the tire did not show any abnormal wear, did otherwise note evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions.   The wind recorded at the airport, about the time of the accident, indicated a left crosswind to tailwind at 9 knots.  Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during touchdown in a crosswind, which resulted in a runway excursion."

After experiencing the loss of engine power, the pilot initiated a landing to a nearby open field.  During the landing roll out, the airplane encountered tall grass and nosed over resulting in substantial damage.  The pilot reported that post accident examination of the airplane's engine revealed that the brass carburetor float travel (total drop travel) was approximately 3/16 of an inch, 5/16 of an inch less than specified for normal operations.  The carburetor float level is a means of regulating the amount of total fuel delivered to the engine via the metering jet.    Probable Cause: Loss of engine power as a result of a carburetor float drop restriction during cruise flight.  Tall grass in the landing area was a factor in the accident."

The pilot reported that the northwest side of the field was unobstructed except for a small wire fence which posed no problem for the off-field landing. The pilot failed to see a small transmission wire which crossed the final approach course about 25ft AGL. The glider struck the wire which caused the glider to nose down about 40 degrees and strike the ground in a wings level altitude."

The pilot selected a field to the right of his final approach course.  The airplane touched down approximately 20 feet short of his intended field.  The airplane struck a wrought iron fence, collapsing the nose gear and the left main landing gear.  An examination of the engine showed no evidence of fuel in the fuel distribution manifold or fuel lines.  An examination of the fuel tanks showed some fuel in the right fuel tank.  An examination of the airplane's, engine controls and remaining systems revealed no anomalies.  Probable Cause: The pilot's improper in-flight planning and decision.

        "details": "While attempting to start the airplane 2 days after an annual inspection, the landing gear warning horn sounded upon activation of the master switch.  The pilot checked the landing gear and found it in the down and locked position with the squat switches depressed.  He also noted that with both of the avionics master switches in the ON position, the landing gear warning horn stopped, the instrument panel lights activated, and the landing gear down and locked green light illuminated.  He made the return flight home and the following day flew the airplane, with the landing gear in the extended position, to an avionics shop.  During the inspection, a shorted terminal in the breaker box was found and repaired.  During a return flight to the pilot's home base the landing gear system functioned normally.  Five days later, the pilot attempted to start the engine.  He realized the battery was dead and got a jump start.  The avionics then failed during the takeoff initial climb.  He recycled the avionics master, but power to the avionics was not returned.  The pilot returned and landed without problems.  The battery was removed, recharged, and then replaced.  The pilot noted that everything functioned properly and he decided to continue his flight. During the takeoff roll, the nose landing gear collapsed and the airplane slid down the runway, with the left main landing gear eventually collapsing.  During an inspection of the aircraft, an FAA inspector noted structural damage to the airframe.  Maintenance personnel inspected the landing gear and electrical system and found no discrepancies.  They replaced a weak battery and cycled the landing gear several times.  They were not able to reproduce the discrepancy encountered by the pilot during the accident takeoff roll.  Probable Cause: Collapse of the landing gear for undetermined reasons."

The pilot aborted the takeoff, pulling the right throttle back and applying wheel brakes.  The airplane slid off the side of the runway into a field and hit a ditch.  Examination of the airplane revealed the left wing had pulled forward, separating the trailing edge from the fuselage approximately 1 1/2 inch and buckling the fuselage at the leading edge.  Probable Cause: The certified flight instructor's poor decision to simulate a loss of engine on takeoff with a wet runway and the pilot's failure to maintain directional control.

        "details": "The airplane collided with mountainous terrain during cruise after encountering turbulence and downdrafts associated with mountain wave conditions.  According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records, the pilot called the Reno Automated Flight Service Station at 0941 and filed an IFR flight plan, then asked for the winds aloft forecast, which was provided.  The pilot did not request any additional weather briefing information for the flight.  No other record was found that the pilot obtained additional weather forecast information from any official source associated with the FAA or the National Weather Service.  At the time of the pilot's call to the Reno AFSS, several AIRMET weather advisories had been issued hours prior detailing warnings for  turbulence and clear icing along the route of flight.  The advisories warned of occasional moderate turbulence below 18,000 feet in moderately strong westerly winds especially in the vicinity of mountainous terrain.  Clear Air Turbulence (CAT) between 18,000 and 40,000 feet was forecast over the area of the accident site due to jet stream wind shear and mountain wave activity. The pilot departed under visual flight rules (VFR) and picked up his instrument flight rules (IFR) clearance en route and climbed to 14,000 feet.  The pilot later asked if he could maintain 12,500 feet.  The controller advised him that the minimum IFR altitude on this segment of his route was 14,000 feet, and the pilot cancelled his IFR flight plan.  The controller advised the pilot that he had lost radar contact, and instructed the pilot to squawk VFR and the pilot acknowledged the transmission.  The last radar target was about 1/2 mile east of Eagle Peak (elevation 9,920 feet) in the Warner Mountains.  Rescuers discovered the wreckage near the crest of Eagle Peak on November 23.  Investigators found no anomalies with the airframe, engines, or propellers that would have precluded normal operation.  The NWS had a full series of AIRMETs current over the proposed route of flight, which included mountain obscuration, turbulence, and icing.  Analysis of the weather conditions disclosed a layer between 9,500 and 11,000 feet over the accident site area as having a high likelihood of severe or greater turbulence.  A pilot on the same route of flight reported at 1127 that he was in instrument conditions at 11,000 feet, and experiencing light turbulence and light clear icing conditions.  He also reported encountering updrafts of 2,000 feet per minute, which was indicative of mountain wave activity.  A company pilot was in a second Aero Commander trailing the accident airplane and he reported that at 1147, at a position near the accident site, he encountered a severe downdraft.  He applied full climb power, but as the airplane passed over the accident site position, the airplane continued to lose altitude even at maximum power.  At 1159, he was able to gain altitude, and return to his assigned cruising altitude of 14,000 feet.  The second Aero Commander was turbocharged, the accident airplane was not.  Analysis showed that the topography of the area was critical in this case, given that the accident site was at an elevation of 9,240 feet on the eastern slope of Eagle Peak.  The accident airplane's flight track was normal along the airway until immediately downwind of the higher terrain.  As the flight approached the lee side of the mountain, it came under the influence of the mountain wave and first encountered an updraft and then a downdraft, which increased in amplitude as the flight progressed towards Eagle Peak.  Eagle Peak was the tallest point along the Warner Mountain range and the steep slope of this terrain was significant when the mountain wave action was encountered.  Such terrain features have been known to enhance the vertical downdrafts and updrafts associated with the most intense mountain wave turbulence. Probable Cause: the pilot's encounter with forecast mountain wave conditions, moderate or greater turbulence, and icing, with downdrafts that likely exceeded the climb capability of the airplane, which was encountered at an altitude that precluded recovery.  Also causal in the accident was the failure of the pilot to obtain an adequate preflight weather briefing which would have included a series of Airmets that were in effect at the time."

        "details": "The flightcrew of a turbojet airplane were landing during dark night VFR conditions at the conclusion of an instrument flight rules (IFR) cross-country aeromedical positioning flight. The captain said he broke out of the cloud base about 1,200 feet msl, 7 miles from the runway. He said he was holding about 15 to 20 degrees of left crab to remain aligned with the runway centerline, and he felt a strong crosswind over the runway threshold. During the landing flare, the left wingtip fuel tank contacted the runway. The captain applied full right aileron and full right rudder, and the airplane touched down on the centerline. After parking, an inspection of the left wingtip fuel tank revealed scraping and flattening of about the aft third of the underside of the fuel tank. The upper surface of the wing, inboard from the tip tank, was wrinkled. The automated weather observing system (AWOS) was reporting, in part:  Wind, 270 degrees at 5 knots; visibility, 9 statute miles; clouds and sky condition, 1,200 feet overcast. The FAA Facility Directory/Alaska Supplement notes that \"Because of natural obstructions, the AWOS-3 wind may be unrepresentative of runway wind conditions.\" The captain indicated that the landing approach speed was flown with additional airspeed to compensate for the wind conditions, and he noted that he could only assume that windshear contributed to the accident.  Probable Cause: The captain's inadequate compensation for wind conditions during the landing flare/touchdown. Contributing to the accident were a crosswind and windshear."

The aircraft slid upright for approximately 1/2 mile following initial ground contact and came to rest on airport property southeast of the runway 10L departure end. The airplane was substantially damaged in the occurrence. The commercial pilot-in-command and three passengers escaped the aircraft without injury; there was no qualified second-in-command aboard. The flight originally received an instrument flight rules (IFR) clearance to Hermiston, Oregon. After taxiing out from the parking ramp at a fixed-base operator (FBO), the pilot called Portland ground control and stated he wanted to return to the ramp. Witnesses at the FBO reported that after returning to the, the airplane shut down and opened its main entry door, and that one of the aircraft occupants told ground service personnel the aircraft had an engine problem. The aircraft remained there for approximately 5 minutes, then started back up and taxied back out. After taxiing out the second time, the pilot cancelled his IFR flight plan to Hermiston with ATC, and requested and received a VFR clearance to Redmond, where the accident aircraft was based. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) recording indicated that the pilot was unable to start the right engine before takeoff, and elected to attempt takeoff with the right engine inoperative. Witnesses reported that the airplane's nose lifted off about 4,100 feet down the runway and that it then became airborne with its wings rocking, attaining a maximum altitude of 5 to 10 feet above the ground before settling back to the ground.Investigators removed the right engine starter-generator from the engine after the accident and found the starter-generator drive shaft to be fractured. The aircraft has a minimum crew requirement of two, consisting of pilot and copilot; the copilot's seat occupant, a private pilot-rated passenger, did not hold a multiengine rating and thus was not qualified to act as second-in-command of the aircraft."

        "details": "Two airplanes, a Cessna U206 Skywagon (N2186F) and a Piper PA-31-350 Chieftain (N76RA), collided midair in a mountain pass while traveling in opposite directions. The pass is a river valley, about 1/2-mile wide, with the floor about 1,000 feet mean sea level (msl), between mountains in excess of 5,000 feet msl. Neither pilot saw the other airplane in time to take evasive action. Both airplanes landed safely after the collision. The airplanes were operating in visual flight rules meteorological conditions, in uncontrolled airspace at about 2,300 feet msl, without any air traffic control services. The westbound Cessna sustained minor damage to its left float and the eastbound Piper sustained substantial damage to its vertical stabilizer and rudder.  The Cessna pilot reported that he was monitoring the common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) for the pass and making position reports. He saw the opposing airplane pass under his left front and heard a loud “thump.” The Cessna was equipped with wingtip- and tail-mounted strobe anticollision lights, which were operating at the time of collision.  The Piper pilot reported that when he spotted the Cessna floatplane he did not have time to take evasive action. He was not monitoring the CTAF, and the airplane he was flying had no anticollision wingtip strobes or any forward-facing lights. A local Federal Aviation Administration publication contains a graphic representation of the pass, and includes remote communications outlets, weather cameras, reference points, and a CTAF for the pass.  Probable Cause: The pilot’s failure to see and avoid the approaching airplane, which did not have any forward-facing lights."

        "details": "The pilot initiated an ILS approach during a period of light snow, and a ceiling of 400 feet.  During the approach, a band of heavy snow, with reduced visibility, moved over the airport.  The pilot reported established on the approach, then acknowledged a frequency change to the airport's common traffic advisory frequency.  No further transmissions were received.  Radar data revealed that the airplane joined the localizer outside the initial approach fix, and proceeded inbound, on course.  Due to limited radar coverage, the last radar contact with the airplane was about 3/4 of a mile inside the final approach fix, still on course, about 1,850 feet above the airport.  A witness, about 1/3 to 1/2 mile to the east of the airport, saw the airplane fly overhead at a very low altitude, then heard the engines rev up, and saw the airplane climb.  The airplane disappeared into the falling snow, and the witness then heard the sound of a crash.  Airplane wreckage was later found on rising terrain, about 1/2 nautical mile to the left of the runway's departure end.  The landing gear and flaps were up, and the elevator was trimmed for a climb.  Trees were initially cut at an ascending angle of about 5 degrees for approximately 50 feet, then a descending angle of about 5 degrees for another 250 feet.  The wreckage elevation was approximately the same as the decision height for the ILS approach.  There was no evidence of pre-accident mechanical failure.        Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to execute the published missed approach procedure.  A factor was heavy snowfall during the approach."

The two pilots and two passengers were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the flight that originated from Harrisburg-Capital City Airport, Pennsylvania, and was destined for Monongahela-Rostraver Airport, Pennsylvania. According to the pilot, the airplane was on approach to Monongahela when he lowered the landing gear handle and heard a crunching noise. He noticed there were no green cockpit indicator lights to confirm that the landing gear was down and locked. The pilot then asked the co-pilot to circle the airport while he looked up the emergency procedures for extending the landing gear in the airplane flight manual. He tried to extend the landing gear manually, but it appeared to be jammed. The pilot and co-pilot discussed the situation and decided to fly to Arnold Palmer Regional Airport (LBE), Latrobe, Pennsylvania since the airport had a control tower and emergency equipment. The pilot flew by the tower and asked if tower personnel could see the landing gear down. The tower controller told him that the landing gear appeared to be down. During the subsequent landing roll , the left main landing gear collapsed, followed shortly by the right main landing gear. The airplane then slid to a stop on the centerline of the runway and the flight crew and passengers egressed the airplane.Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed that the main landing gear mechanical linkage was compromised, and the right main landing gear actuator shaft was broken. The actuator was retained for further examination."

The pilot noted that the gyroplane did not want to climb or maintain altitude and began descend.  The pilot commanded a right turn and the descent rate began to increase.  The forced landing was set up in a nearby field.  A hard landing was reported by the pilot and the gyroplane rolled onto its left side.  The pilot was able to egress without assistance.  A review of the pilot's log book revealed that the student pilot had not received an endorsement from a flight instructor within the prescribed 90 days of the solo flight.  An NTSB 6120 was not submitted prior to the completion of this case.  Probable Cause: The student pilot's failure to maintain control of the gyroplane.  Contributing to the accident was the lack of recent flight instruction prior to the flight."

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.According to the pilot of the Falcon 2000, subsequent to the preflight and the before takeoff checklist being completed, and with the parking brake set to ON, a ground handling crewman pulled the wheel chocks from the landing gear. The pilot reported that as soon as the chocks were removed, the airplane starting rolling across the ramp. The pilot stated that he immediately applied the toe brakes, however, they were not effective in stopping the airplane. He then applied the emergency braking system, but that too was ineffective in slowing or stopping the airplane. The pilot added that as the Falcon continued across the ramp, its right wing went over and scraped the top of the left wing of a parked Falcon 50 before colliding with the Beech C90 in a near head on collision with its radome."

        "details": "A Bombardier Global 6000, operated by Silver Air Corp., took off from Tokyo International Airport as a charter flight. While the aircraft was flying at FL400 to Tan Son Nhat International Airport, Vietnam, the instruments indicated a loss of cabin pressurization. The flight crew declared an emergency and made an emergency descent until the aircraft reached an altitude of approximately 10,000 ft. The Pilot in Command changed its destination to Naha Airport and the aircraft landed at Naha Airport at 18:32.  PROBABLE CAUSES The JTSB concludes that the probable cause of this serious incident was the shutdown of both PACKs of the Aircraft during the flight at FL400, which resulted in loss of cabin pressurization. Concerning the shutdown of both PACKs, it is highly probable that the flight crew member was going to operate the switches of fuel recirculation system but erroneously pushed both PACK switches to position “OFF” without noticing."

During the second practice autorotation, the pilot reduced power with throttle and used collective to adjust rotor speed to 410 RPM (minimum RPM for practice autorotations).  The rotor RPM decreased below 410 RPM and the aircraft rapidly started to descend. Before the pilot was able to recover, the aircraft collided with the ground and rolled over.  The aircraft sustained substantial damage to the main rotor blades, tail rotor, tail boom and fuselage.  The pilot reported no mechanical failures or malfunctions with the aircraft at the time of the accident.   Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to maintain rotor RPM during an autorotation."

        "details": "On June 14, 2012, at 16:37 EDT (Eastern Daylight Time), a Robinson R22 Mariner, N1089N, registered to Watercraft Photo Helicopter LLC, collided with the Atlantic Ocean about 10 yards off shore while practising a simulated auto rotation in the vicinity of Oak Island, North Carolina. The helicopter sustained substantial damage. Visual meteorological condition prevailed and no flight plan was filed. The helicopter was operating as a 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. The private pilot and commercial pilot passenger reported no injuries. The flight originated from Wilmington, North Carolina at 16:30 EDT.  The pilot stated she was in cruise flight at 600 feet mean sea level at 75 knots, when she entered an autorotation over the ocean, with an intention of a power recovery. She lowered the collective pitch to the full down position and rolled the throttle to the full off position. She then raised the collective pitch. The main rotor rpm started to decrease and the low main rotor audio sounded. She rolled on the throttle and increased collective and the main rotor rpm continued to decrease. The helicopter continued to descend until it impacted the ocean and rolled over inverted.  The pilot rated passenger stated when the pilot informed him that she wanted to do an autorotation, replied that he did not feel comfortable with because he did not have that many hours in the left seat. In addition, he was not sure if they could do an autorotation without an instructor pilot on board the helicopter. When asked if there was anything mechanically wrong with the helicopter, before the pilot initiated the autorotation, the passenger stated no, \"It was an improper use of flight controls.\"  Examination of the helicopter revealed one main rotor blade was damaged. The cabin floor, sidewall structure, and center console had separated from the main structure just forward of the forward cabin seats. The bottom of the fuselage was buckled. The left rear skid mount was separated and the skid assembly was displaced forward. The tailboom assembly was buckled on the lower left side at its attachment point. There was evidence of a main rotor blade strike on the tailboom assembly.  The R22 Maneuver Guide, STRAIGHT-IN AUTOROTATION WITH POWER RECOVERY states,  \"1. The Entry - From level flight at 70 to 75 kts, 500 to 700 feet AGL, and headed into the wind, smoothly, but firmly, lower the collective full down without reducing the throttle. Coordinate the collective movement with right pedal; for trim and aft cyclic to maintain a 75 kt attitude.... 2. The Glide - After descent has been established, slowly reduce the airspeed to 60 to 70 kts and maintain this attitude throughout the glide....NOTE As the aircraft descends through 100 feet AGL, make an immediate power recovery if the following conditions do not exists: 1. Rotor rpm in the green. 2. Airspeed 60 to 70 kts. 3. Rate of descent less than 1500 feet.  3. The Flare - At approximately 40 feet AGL, begin the flare with aft cyclic to reduce forward airspeed and decrease the rate of descent....4. The Power Recovery - At approximately 8 to 10 feet skid height, begin to level the helicopter with forward cyclic.\"  Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to properly execute the helicopter practice auto rotation recovery, which resulted in a collision with the water. The aircraft was presumably written off (damaged beyond repair) probably to immersion in salt water, although the registration N1089N was not cancelled by the FAA until May 31, 2018, almost six years later."

The two pilots on board the airplane (a commercial pilot and an airline transport pilot) and three people on the ground were killed. Four people on the ground received serious injuries. The airplane and two homes were destroyed by impact forces and a postcrash fire. The personal flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 on an instrument flight rules flight plan. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  Probable Cause: Actions and decisions by National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing's corporate aviation division's management and maintenance personnel to allow the accident airplane to be released for flight with a known and unresolved discrepancy, and the accident pilots' decision to operate the airplane with that known discrepancy, a discrepancy that likely resulted in an in-flight fire."

Due to the prevailing wind, traffic flow at the time of the pilot's arrival was on runway 15. Another airplane was departing the airport in the opposite direction and crossed in close proximity to the accident airplane. The departing traffic altered his course to the right to avoid the accident airplane while the accident airplane stayed on his final approach course. The two aircraft were in radio communication on the airport common traffic advisory frequency and were exercising see-and-avoid rules as required.  Witnesses reported that as the airplane continued down runway 33 for landing, they heard the power increase and observed the airplane make a left-hand turn to depart the runway in an attempted go-around. The airplane entered a left bank with a nose-high attitude, failed to gain altitude, and subsequently stalled and impacted terrain. It is likely the pilot did not maintain the necessary airspeed during the attempted go-around and exceeded the airplane's critical angle of attack. The investigation did not reveal why the pilot chose to conduct the approach with opposing traffic or why he attempted a landing with a tailwind, but this likely increased the pilot's workload during a critical phase of flight.       Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed and exceedance of the critical angle of attack during a go-around with a tailwind condition, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall. A contributing factor to the accident was the pilot's decision to continue the approach with opposing traffic."

Additional parts of the upper and lower right wings were found scattered throughout an area between 400 yards to 800 yards west of the impact area, and other parts of the wings were found about 80 yards from the wreckage; however, the majority of the wing structure was not found.  The right wing attachment fittings displayed fractures intersecting the inboard wing spar attachment bolt hole. The fracture features for each attachment fitting were rough and matte gray in appearance, consistent with ductile overstress fracture and with upward bending of the wing at the attachment location. The outboard end of the attachment fitting piece for the aft spar was also bent aft relative to the inboard end, consistent with the entire upper and lower right wings folding upward and rearward, bending and separating from the airplane. Because this airplane is a biplane, the upward bending of the lower wing attachment was secondary to a primary failure elsewhere, the location of which could not be determined due to the fact that a majority of the wing structure was unrecovered. There was no evidence of any preexisting damage on the wing spar attachment fittings.  Probable Cause: An in-flight separation of the right wing due to upward and rearward bending that led to an overstress fracture. The reason for the upward and rearward bending could not be determined based on the available information."

        "details": "The flight instructor was providing a demonstration/instructional flight to the passenger the day after the powered parachute had been setup as a static display at an air show. After performing a preflight inspection and arranging the parachute, the flight instructor briefed the passenger that they would approach the runway from the northwest, and then depart along the runway to the south. The flight instructor then started the engine, “kited” the parachute, and proceeded southeast toward the runway and the 75-foot-tall trees along its eastern edge. Upon reaching the western edge of the runway, the flight instructor increased the engine power, and the powered parachute lifted off from the ground; however, it was still oriented at an angle to the runway, and it continued on its southeasterly track toward the trees ahead. The flight instructor attempted to use the steering controls of the parachute to steer the vehicle to the right away from the trees but found them to be ineffective. He then attempted to pull on both of the steering lines to give the parachute additional lift, but the vehicle then impacted the tops of the trees and fell to the ground. A postaccident examination revealed a noticeable relative difference in the adjusted length of the left and right steering lines, which was also evident in an onboard video of the accident flight. According to published FAA guidance regarding takeoffs in powered parachutes, “The takeoff surface should be firm, free of debris, and not have any obstructions along the takeoff path.” Probable Cause: The flight instructor’s failure to ensure an obstruction-free takeoff path prior to initiating the takeoff and his inadequate preflight inspection of the powered parachute’s flight controls, which resulted in a collision with trees during the takeoff."

        "details": "On March 19, 2000, at 1545 Pacific standard time, a Bell 212 helicopter, N415B, was destroyed after impacting terrain following a loss of control while in cruise flight near Snelling, California. The commercial pilot, who was the sole occupant, received fatal injuries. The aircraft was being operated as a positioning flight by Aviation International Rotors (A.I.R.), Inc., Apple Valley, California, under 14 CFR Part 91 when the accident occurred. The flight originated from Fresno, California, at 1515, and was destined for Sacramento, California. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and a company visual flight rules (VFR) flight plan had been filed.  The twin-engine helicopter impacted terrain following a mast bumping event and subsequent the loss of control.  The helicopter was the second in a flight of two and trailed the lead helicopter by a short distance.  The lead pilot noticed the second helicopter wreckage after the pilot did not receive a radio response from the accident pilot; he reported receiving no distress transmissions from the accident pilot.  The first helicopter pilot reported they were in cruise flight between 400 - 500 feet agl at 100 knots.  He said that he encountered a large bird about 1 mile before the accident. A 12-foot section of one of the main rotor blades was found early on in the wreckage debris path, which equaled approximately 1,000 feet in length and was oriented along the flight's course.  Cut portions of the left skid, battery door, and the left elevator were found early on in the debris path.  The separated main rotor blade underwent an overhaul approximately 8.3 hours prior to the accident.  The main rotor mast displayed evidence of a mast bumping event, with indentations corresponding to the blade stops.  The mast separated at the blade stop area. The commercial helicopter pilot was wearing a cast on his right leg, which extended from below his knees to his toes. The pilot received a check-out flight after not flying for 3 months.  According to the pilot who provided the check-out flight, the accident pilot performed a few traffic pattern operations and was found to be able to fly. A mechanic who flew with the accident pilot during the first legs of the flight indicated the pilot was able to fly with no problems.  Though there was evidence of a mast bumping event, the initiating event is unknown. Examination of the wreckage disclosed no anomalies that would have prevented normal system operation and the engines displayed evidence of rotation at the time of ground impact. The main rotor blade with the separated section was examined and it was noted that its failure was a result of overload separation and did not delaminate in flight.  Probable Cause: the in-flight separation of the main rotor mast while in cruise flight following a mast bumping event. The reason for the mast bumping event was not determined."

According to the pilot, the airplane performed normally during the preflight, takeoff, and skydiving operations. Then, while on the final approach leg to runway 35, about 80 ft above ground level and a \"few feet before the threshold,\" the windshield became \"foggy outside\" and the pilot could not see the runway. He did not attempt to abort the landing because the jumpers were in the area and he did not want to risk hitting any of them or trees surrounding the runway. The pilot maintained the airplane heading and descent, he felt the main landing gear touchdown, applied reverse thrust, and then felt the nose landing gear collapse before the propeller struck the ground and the airplane came to rest.An NTSB review of a witness video recording revealed that during the landing, the nose landing gear contacted the runway first, followed by the main landing gear, and the airplane bounced. Next, the nose landing gear impacted the runway prior to collapsing and the airplane continued down the runway out of view.An examination of the wreckage by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed that the nose landing gear separated from the airplane. In addition, part of the fuselage structure and an engine mount were substantially damaged."

While performing an emergency landing to a highway, the airplane's nose landing gear would not extend. The pilot landed the airplane, which slid to a halt. A postaccident examination revealed thermal distortion to the airplane's nose gear door, which impeded normal operation of the nose landing gear. Clamps on the turbocharger's intermediate exhaust crossover tube were found to be unsecured, which would allow exhaust gases to damage the engine's accessories. The examination also found signatures of thermal distress to the fuel flow transducer and fuel flow transducer line. The unsecured clamps and heat signatures were consistent with exhaust gases compromising the fuel flow transducer line, which resulted in a source of ignition and fuel for the in-flight fire. No additional preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures were found that would have precluded normal operation. A review of maintenance logbooks noted that a propeller strike had occurred about 3 months before the accident and that repairs were completed about 1 month later, when the engine, including the turbocharger, was removed, cleaned, and inspected. The airplane had flown about 4 hours since the repair. Probable Cause: The mechanic's improper installation of the turbocharger's exhaust balance system, which resulted in an in-flight fire."

According to the pilot there were no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.   A review of recorded data from the automated weather observation station located on the airport, revealed that, about 10 minutes before the accident the wind was 290 degrees true at 8 knots. A further review revealed that, about 10 minutes after the accident the wind was 240 degrees true at 5 knots. The airplane landed on runway 02.

In an effort to maintain directional control the pilot applied braking, however the aircraft ground-looped, coming to rest on the east side of the runway.  When the pilot exited the aircraft he noted that the tail wheel assembly had separated from the airframe.  Post-crash examination revealed that the tail wheel stinger sleeve, into which the stinger/tail wheel assembly bolts, had separated from the airframe at both the base of the rudder post and the lateral cross tube. Examination of the fracture surfaces of the sleeve where it attached to the lateral cross tube revealed discoloration of a portion of the tube end.  The pilot/owner reported that only the top and bottom of the fish mouth joint had been welded to the tail wheel stinger tube where it attached to the lateral cross tube, and that 'failure at this joint allowed the tailwheel to break free of the airframe.'  Probable Cause: Cracking of the weld between the tailwheel stinger housing and longitudinal cross tube, resulting in separation of the tube/tail wheel assembly from the airframe."

        "details": "The flight instructor and passenger, departed on a flight with two other airplanes to conduct simulated air-to-air combat maneuvers. Two airplanes at a time would maneuver against each other, while the other airplane observed from a higher altitude and safe distance. Examination of onboard video and audio recordings revealed that this portion of the flight was uneventful, however, following the series of aerobatic maneuvers, the passenger began experiencing air-sickness.   While returning to the airport, the airplanes flew a planned low-level flight (minimum altitude of 30 ft agl) in trail formation to simulate a bombing run. The accident airplane was the last airplane in the formation. During this time, the pilot communicated to the passenger, that he would fly the airplane \"nice and easy.\" After climbing over a ridgeline, and descending back towards the desert floor, the airplane approached a small hill. Video indicated that the passenger, who was seated in the front seat, likely knew that a ground collision was imminent but was unable to communicate effectively with the pilot, since his microphone was out of position. The airplane subsequently impacted terrain near the top of the hill. The video showed the airplane flying at a normal speed and attitude before the impact occurred, with no indication of an evasive maneuver. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.  Although the airplane encountered precipitation during the low-level portion of the flight, the precipitation did not appear to reduce forward visibility or obscure the terrain. However, the tandem seating configuration of the airplane made it difficult for the rear-seated flight instructor to see the areas directly in front of and below the airplane. As such, pilots normally conducted \"check turns\" during low-level operations to ensure obstacle and terrain clearance. Video from the accident airplane and another airplane in the formation indicated that the accident pilot performed 4 check turns during the approximate 2-minute low-level flight; the other pilot performed 8 check turns during this time. It is likely that the accident pilot intentionally conducted fewer check turns, to clear for terrain and obstacles, because of the passenger's airsickness.   Toxicology testing of the pilot detected tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the primary psychoactive component of marijuana) in tissue sample; however, because the antemortem blood levels of THC could not be directly computed and because there is no direct relationship established between blood levels of THC and impairment, whether the pilot's use of marijuana contributed to the accident could not be determined from the available evidence.  Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to monitor and maintain clearance with terrain while maneuvering at low level. Contributing to the accident, was the pilot's failure to conduct an adequate amount of clearing turns while maneuvering at low level."

        "details": "As the NOTAR (No Tail Rotor) helicopter entered a normal descent on downwind for landing, control was lost and the helicopter entered an uncontrollable left spin as it descended to ground impact.  A stress corrosion fracture and separation of a fitting in the anti-torque system thruster control cable resulted in a fixed jet thruster nozzle setting and precluded the pilot from controlling the left yawing rotation.  RFM (Rotorcraft Flight Manual) procedures provided inadequate information for the pilot to understand the anti-torque system and apply proper corrective action to minimize the effects of the stuck thruster condition.  FAA and the manufacturer failed to recognize the implications and significance of a known stress corrosion cracking problem and take appropriate preventative measures in a timely manner.  Maintenance diagnostic actions were inadequate to correctly diagnose a yaw control system anomaly reported by the pilot 2 days prior to this flight.  The pilot's negative transfer of anti-torque failure procedures from a conventionally designed helicopter precipitated improper pilot control input in response to the fixed jet thruster nozzle condition.  A compilation of ground witness observations revealed that the helicopter began a yaw to the right from normal straight flight, then suddenly reversed direction and entered into a rapid left rotation as it descended to the ground.  Radar data showed the flight was uneventful until 11 seconds after completing a left turn to a downwind heading and beginning a normal descent for landing.  At this point, a spike was observed in the Mode C altitude readout, indicating that a large sideslip angle had occurred inducing a static system pressure anomaly, and, probably represents the ground witness observed initial yaw to the right.  The helicopter's airspeed profile until the onset of the right yaw was normal and within the expected cruise range for this point in the flight.  The altitude spike was also coincident with the pilot's first mayday call to the tower controller and strongly indicates that the emergency situation had evolved to a state which alarmed the pilot.  The helicopter's NOTAR anti-torque yaw control system utilizes a transmission driven fan with variable pitch blades to supply air to circulation control slots on the tail boom and a pilot controlled directional jet thruster nozzle.  The yaw control system has sufficient authority to induce large and prolonged sideslip angles at cruise flight airspeeds.  Pilot control of the jet thruster nozzle uses torque tubes from the cockpit anti-torque pedals to a splitter assembly at Fuselage Station (FS)113.  Torque tubes transmit pedal movement from the splitter to the fan blade pitch change mechanism to increase airflow in the tail boom as the pedals are displaced from neutral in either direction.  A three-part cable transmits motion from the FS113 splitter to the jet thruster nozzle to control its directional orientation.  The forward and center cables have a Teflon-coated inner steel control wire which slides back and forth in an outer sleeve.  At the FS113 splitter, a telescoping sleeve ball swivel coupling retained by a swaged lip allows for angular displacement of the cable rod end as the splitter assembly rotates.  During postaccident examination of the NOTAR jet thruster control cable, a fracture and separation was found in the cable's telescoping sleeve ball swivel coupling swaged lip, which was subsequently identified as caused by stress corrosion.  With the retaining lip missing, the ball swivel coupling is not restrained and will allow the inner wire to slide out of the outer sleeve.  As the cable moves out of the sleeve (left cockpit control pedal movement), the exposed cable will bow and not transmit any subsequent right pedal movement back to the jet thruster nozzle to counter left yaw.  Metallurgical examination found that the fitting's failure and separation preceded this flight by some length of time.  The Teflon coating of the inner cable was severely abraded, indicating that it had been operating  Probable Cause: The pilot's in-flight loss of control due to the failure and separation of the forward thruster control cable telescoping sleeve ball swivel fitting, which resulted in a stuck thruster and the entry into an uncontrollable yaw/spin.  Also causal was the mechanics improper maintenance actions during diagnostics to determine the cause of a yaw control anomaly in that he failed to remove an access panel over the FS113 splitter to fully and completely examine the thruster control cable.  Factors in the accident were: (1) the incomplete emergency procedures/system explanations in the RFM for a stuck thruster condition;  (2) the pilot's negative transfer of emergency procedures from the HH-60, which likely induced him to make incorrect inputs to throttle, collective, and the anti-torque controls during the onset of the stuck thruster condition; and (3) MDHI and the cable manufacturer's failure to expeditiously diagnose and correct the stress corrosion cracking problem in the forward thruster cable ball swivel fitting."

        "details": "On May 15, 1998, at 1258 Eastern Daylight Time, a Cessna 175B, N7SB, was destroyed during a forced landing approximately 1 mile south of the Republic Airport, Farmingdale, New York.  The certificated commercial pilot received minor injuries, and the passenger was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  No flight plan had been filed for the local flight conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.  The pilot stated that after takeoff, and passing through 150 feet, the airplane's engine rpm was 2,400 to 2,500 rpm, and then dropped to 2,100 rpm.  After the rpm drop, the pilot applied carburetor heat, and \"mags were cleared.  Rpm further dropped to 1,900.\"  The pilot felt he couldn't avoid a fence at the end of the airport, and there was not enough room to land straight ahead.  The \"decision to continue the climb was made when rpm increased back to 2,100.\"  About 250 feet, the engine began losing power again.   The pilot stated he was \"too low and too slow\" to turn back to the field, and continued straight ahead.  He cleared some trees, power lines, and a highway, and saw several buildings with flat roofs.  Since he saw no other areas clear of obstructions, he decided to land on the largest building.  At touchdown, the airplane struck an air conditioner and punctured the building's roof.  It skidded off the roof into a tree, and went nose-down into a storage shed.  A small fire started in the engine compartment, and was extinguished by the passenger.  According to a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Inspector, post flight inspection revealed no water or debris during disassembly of the carburetor, and the airplane was turned over to a salvage facility.  The 1961 Cessna 175B Owner's Manual stated that normal takeoff and climb airspeeds were accomplished at full throttle.  The owner's manual also stated that initial climb speed after takeoff was 84 mph, and normal climb airspeed thereafter was between 90 and 100 mph.  The pilot said that he took off with full throttle and flaps up, and that he climbed between 90 and 100 mph.  According to original certification data, and based on a McCauley 8464 fixed pitch propeller and full throttle, 90 mph should have resulted in a 2,990 rpm indication, and 100 mph should have resulted in a 3,070 rpm indication.   In the operational data section of the owner's manual, takeoff distance data was available for a standard day and 20 degrees flaps from a hard surface runway.  There was no chart for a \"flaps up\" takeoff.  However, according to a 1964 Cessna Aircraft Company comparative ground roll study, adding another 10% to the 20 degree flap takeoff distance would result in a reliable takeoff distance with the flaps up.  The ambient temperature was 73 degrees Fahrenheit, and there was a note on the chart to increase takeoff distance by 10% for each 25 degrees Fahrenheit above standard temperature.  Headwind at the time of takeoff was 10 knots, and the pilot said the airplane was about 200 pounds under maximum gross weight.  Utilizing the takeoff data chart with the above criteria, the airplane should have required less than a 700 foot ground run to take off with full power.    The pilot wrote that he began the takeoff roll at \"the very beginning\" of Runway 19, that the \"ground run was normal, and initial liftoff occurred at approximately the intersection of Runway 14.\"  According to airport diagrams, the intersection was about 2,800 feet from the beginning of Runway 19.  In the cruising section of the owner's manual, cruising rpm was stated as between 2,400 and 3,200 rpm.  According to a carburetor icing probability chart in Tips on Winter Flying, FAA-P-8740-24, ambient conditions during the flight's timeframe would have produced \"moderate icing\" at cruising rpm.  With reduced power, the degree of icing would have increased for the same ambient conditions.  Avco Lycoming published Service Instruction 1148B on May 4, 1973.  Representatives from both Cessna and Teledyne-Continental stated that it was applicable to c"

The pilot increased the collective to stop the decent, and began to concentrate on the aft drift, when the helicopter touched down on the right main and nose landing gear.  The pilot added left cyclic to level the helicopter, but due to low rotor rpm, the control input had little effect.  The helicopter began to roll to the right, and the main rotor blades impacted the ground.  The helicopter came to rest on its right side.  According to the pilot's flight instructor, the accident flight was the pilot's fifth flight of the day, with the first four dual instructional flights being conducted in a Kaman H-43.  The last flight was to be conducted solo in the K-1200.  The pilot had previously flown the K-1200 four times. Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control while hovering.  A factor related to the accident was the pilots lack of experience in type of aircraft."

The airplane's engine seized as the pilot and passenger prepared to bail out, and they were thrown clear. Both the pilot and passenger pulled their parachute ripcords and fell into trees. Examination of the wreckage revealed the cowl flap was crushed in the open position. A small amount of fluid was found in the radiator. The water pump and accessory assembly were destroyed.

The pilot controlled the pitch attitude using power and elevator trim as he flew back to an airport to land.  The pilot decided to land at a higher than normal airspeed so he could maintain control of the airplane.  The airplane bounced twice during the landing.  During the second runway impact, the main gear collapsed.  The airplane slid approximately 200 feet and veered off the right side of the runway prior to coming to rest and sustained substantial damage to the right wing. A post accident examination of the airplane revealed the elevator push-pull rod was fractured through the first full thread of the threaded shaft adjacent to the conical section.  The remaining threaded section of the rod was threaded into the monoball spherical bearing fitting.  A metallurgical examination revealed a fatigue fracture that initiated from both sides of the threaded shank on the rod end.  Examination of the monoball bearing revealed several dents in the metallic bearing shield.  The shape, size, and location of the dents and the deformation of the bearing shield were consistent with over-travel contact by the boss on the monoball bearing.  Probable Cause: A fatigue failure of the elevator push-pull rod which resulted in the pilot's inability to control the aircraft's pitch attitude while landing."

The pilot and passenger were not injured.As the aircraft approached its cruising altitude of FL430, the indicated airspeed decreased to about 128 knots. The pilot then reduced the rate of climb to 500 ft/min. However, over the next 50 seconds, the speed gradually reduced by a further 10 kts.Close to FL430, the pilot checked his tablet to check the forecast. At that moment the aircraft pitched severely nose-down and rolled to the right, departing from controlled flight in a series of five 360° rolls to the right. The pilot briefly regained control before the aircraft stalled again and in the following recovery. The aircrafts wings were damaged in overload due to the +4.48g peak in acceleration, which was between the +3.6g ('limit' load) and +5.4g ('ultimate' load). The pilot returned to Leeds/Bradford at FL280 and made a successful landing."

The control system was replaced by pieces of tire and broken rim parts damaged the flaps and parts of the fuselage of the aircraft.    As a result of the damage the flap control system created a flap asymmetry and a roll moment. The crew discharged fuel and returned to airport. During the landing on runway 06, the other front tire of the left fuselage landing gear has jumped. Because with the flange of the rims of the left fuselage landing gear has driven over the runways, these are both seriously damaged\"."

The pilot hand-propped the engine, it started, the throttle was \"too far in,\" and the airplane accelerated forward.

The pilot selected a dirt road for an emergency landing, during which the nose landing gear touched down on a soft surface, and the airplane nosed over. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left and right wings and the front windshield. The pilot reported that the airplane had 4.5 gallons of fuel on board at the last takeoff. A Federal Aviation Administration inspector reported that, during postaccident examination of the airplane, the fuel tanks were found empty. The gascolator had residual fuel, and about 1 gallon of fuel was removed from the fuselage fuel drain. He added that, according to the manufacturer’s specifications, the airplane should have had 1.5 gallons of unusable fuel. He turned on the airplane’s master power switch to view the fuel quantity gauge indications, and the left-wing tank gauge indicated between empty and a quarter full with no fuel in the tank, and the right-wing fuel tank gauge indicated empty.   Probable Cause: The pilot’s improper preflight fuel planning, which resulted in fuel exhaustion and a subsequent total loss of engine power."

After completing four touch-and-go landings, they departed the pattern to do some air work, which included steep turns and a stall. At 3,500 feet agl, approximately 3 to 4 miles north of the airport, the engine lost all power. The instructor stated that he was unable to reach the airport using \"best glide.\" The instructor made a forced landing in a field approximately 1/2 mile east-northeast of the approach end of runway 28. When the airplane impacted the ground, both the left and right main landing gear assemblies collapsed, the upper wing assembly was displaced aft, and the lower left wing, left horizontal stabilizer, and elevator were buckled. An examination of the airplane revealed 4 inches of fuel in the airplane's main fuel tank and no fuel in the wing tank. No other anomalies were found.  Probable Cause: the instructor's improper in-flight planning/decision making and fuel mismanagement which resulted in fuel starvation/exhaustion, the loss of engine power and the subsequent forced landing. Contributing factors include the instructor's inadequate preflight planning/preparation and the lack of suitable terrain for a forced landing."

        "details": "The glider pilot was practicing for an upcoming glider competition.  He usually had his wife help him assemble the glider.  This day he had sent her out for radio batteries and when she returned he had already assembled the horizontal stabilator to the vertical tail section.  A short while later the pilot indicated he was ready to fly the glider.  As the tow plane began to tow the glider, the wife held the wing.  As she released the wing, she said she heard a noise and observed the horizontal stabilator lying on the runway as it had fallen off the aircraft.  The wife immediately ran over to a man standing nearby who had a radio, and told him to contact her husband on the radio and tell him to release the aircraft from the tow plane.  She watched the man transmit the message to the glider pilot, without success.  The aircraft left the runway, climbed to approximately 100 feet agl, and nosed over and crashed into the runway. Postaccident investigation of the glider pilot's handheld radio determined it was incorrectly set to the wrong frequency.  Additionally, examination of the vertical stabilator revealed that the stabilator was improperly installed prior to the accident flight.   Probable Cause: The flight control stabilator becoming disconnected during the initial ground tow.  Factors in the accident were the inadequate preflight by the pilot and communications with the pilot not possible."

During the encounter, a flight attendant was seriously injured.   According to the operator, on descent into CLT the flight crew received an ACARS message from the company dispatcher handling the flight. The dispatcher indicated that a SIGMET was issued for the North Carolina area with strong winds and embedded thunderstorms. The International Relief Officer (IRO) contacted the flight attendants to advise them they would be entering an area of possible turbulence in approximately 15 minutes. An announcement was also made to the passengers over the public address system advising them to remain seated and fasten their seat belts. The seat belt sign was illuminated. The airplane was descending through approximately 16,000 feet when it entered the clouds and encountered moderate turbulence.   In the cabin, the flight attendants began preparing the cabin for arrival after receiving the turbulence advisory from the IRO. Several flight attendants were still out of their seats collecting service items and securing the galley when the turbulence encounter occurred. The \"C\" flight attendant was securing the aft galley during the encounter. She was lifted into the air, fell back down onto the cabin floor, and landed on her back. The \"D\" and \"G\" flight attendants also sustained minor injuries.   The flight crew contacted the flight attendants after the encounter and were notified of their injuries. The flight crew arranged for paramedics to meet the flight and remove the injured flight attendants.   The \"C\" flight attendant received a fracture to the distal tibia at the medial and lateral malleoli.  Probable Cause: an encounter with moderate turbulence while the flight attendant was securing the cabin for arrival."

Upon observing a stop message on the guidance system he set the aircraft’s parking brake. After completing the aircraft’s shutdown procedure he observed an ok message. Believing chocks were in place he released the parking brake.  Having observed the parking brake light illuminate, initially the ground crew placed a chock behind the aircraft’s nose wheel. They then noticed the aircraft starting to move so quickly withdrew to a safe location. The commander heard “we are moving” so he “jumped” on the toe brakes and reset the parking brake.  At the time the commander was not aware the aircraft had hit anything. It was subsequently discovered that the front cowl of the left engine was damaged as a result of impacting the airbridge. There were no injuries. The aircraft had rolled about 0.4m, measured by the stand guidance system\"."

        "details": "On September 13, 2023, at 1255 eastern daylight time, a Eurocopter EC135T2, N273AM, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Fargo, Georgia. The airline transport pilot and a passenger were not injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 positioning flight.  In a written statement, the pilot stated the helicopter had been in cruise flight approximately 1 hour about 1,500 ft mean sea level (msl) when the accident occurred. She stated that there were no faults or warnings displayed and all systems were in the “normal” range when she heard a “bang” and felt a “very strong” vibration in the tail rotor pedals. The pilot immediately identified a site for a precautionary landing which she completed without further incident. Initial examination of the Fenestron, a 10-bladed tail rotor that acts as a ducted fan for antitorque control, revealed that one blade was separated at its root. The cover for the tail rotor gearbox and pitch-change controls was separated and found directly beneath the gearbox. The surrounding Fenestron shroud was damaged. All blade grips remained in their mounts, and the remaining 9 blades appeared intact.  The pilot held an airline transport certificate with ratings for rotorcraft-helicopter and instrument helicopter. Her Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) second class medical certificate was issued November 8, 2022. The pilot declared 5,867 total hours of flight experience, of which 5,816 were in helicopters and 970 hours were in the accident helicopter make and model.  According to FAA and maintenance records, the helicopter was manufactured in 2003 and was powered by two Turbomeca Arrius 2B 492-horsepower engines. The helicopter’s most recent inspection under the operator’s approved inspection program was completed September 12, 2023, at 9,484 total aircraft hours.  The Fenestron blades were harvested and forwarded to the NTSB Materials Laboratory in Washington, DC, for examination. The blades were numbered 1-10, with the fractured blade identified as No. 10. The separated portion of the No. 10 blade was not recovered. The examination of the fracture surface of the No. 10 blade revealed features consistent with fatigue. All 10 blades were retained for further examination."

When asked if he knew why the airplane started to move, he stated that he \"believes that his son, [the PIC had] assumed that [he] had opened the entry door and completed chocking the aircraft wheels.\" According to the FO, the PIC \"mistakenly released the parking brake which had been set during the normal shutdown checklist procedure.\"  Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to ensure that the airplane's wheels were properly secured before releasing the parking brake."

Inspection of the engine revealed damage to the Nos. 5 and 8 bearings consistent with the reduced oil supply to the bearings during engine operation, which resulted in a catastrophic engine failure. Due to the severity of the damage to the bearing components, it could not be determined whether any preaccident malfunctions or failures existed in the bearing assembly that could have led to the reduction in the oil supply.

        "details": "According to the pilot, after he took off for a nearby airport he raised the landing gear but did not raise the 20-degree flaps per the “after takeoff” checklist. Shortly thereafter, when the airplane was at an altitude of about 2,400 feet, and in \"heavy rain,\" the pilot noticed that the right engine was losing power. He subsequently feathered the propeller as engine power reduced to 40 percent, but still did not raise the flaps. Weather, recorded shortly before the accident, included scattered clouds at 500 feet, and a broken cloud layer at 1,200 feet, and the pilot advised air traffic control (ATC) that he would fly an ILS (instrument landing system) approach if he could maintain altitude. After maneuvering, and advising ATC that he could not maintain altitude, the pilot descended the airplane to a right base leg where, about 1/4 nautical mile from the runway, it was approximately 300 feet above the terrain. The pilot completed the landing, with the airplane touching down about 6,200 feet down the 8,000-foot runway, heading about 20 degrees to the left. The airplane veered off the left side of the runway and subsequently went through an airport fence. The left engine was running at “high speed” when fire fighters responded to the scene. The right engine propeller was observed in the feathered position at the scene, and after subsequent examinations, the right engine was successfully run in a test cell with no noticeable loss of power. There was no determination as to why the right engine lost power in flight, although rain ingestion is a possibility. Airplane performance calculations indicated that with the landing gear up, a proper single-engine power setting and airspeed, and flaps raised, the airplane should have been able to climb about 650 feet per minute. Even with flaps at 20 degrees, it should have been able to climb at 350 feet per minute. In either case, unless the airplane was not properly configured, there was no reason why it should not have been able to maintain the altitudes needed to position it for a stabilized approach. Probable Cause: The pilot’s improper configuration of the airplane following an engine shutdown, which resulted in a low-altitude, unstabilized approach. Contributing to the accident was a loss of engine power for undetermined reasons."

The airport manager came on the radios and reported the winds as 280o at 8 knots, gusting to 19 knots. The crew captured the glidepath before the final approach fix and the co-pilot called out speeds to touchdown, the last being 115 kts. The touchdown was normal, but then the airplane experienced a strong yaw to the left from a wind gust. The pilot attempted to steer the airplane back, but the airplane went off the left side of the runway, struck a taxiway sign, and came to a stop with the nose of the airplane facing the runway. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left inboard wing and lower left fuselage. The crew reported no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.  At the time of the accident, the airplane was landing on runway 33 with reported winds 280o at 8 knots with gusts to 24 knots.  Following the accident, the company put in place stricter crosswind component limits for its’ fleet of airplanes.  Probable Cause: The pilot’s inability to maintain directional control during landing with a gusting left crosswind resulting in the runway excursion."

The pilot reported one hard jolt up/down followed by about 15 seconds of light turbulence then one final hard jolt similar to the first. The weather was visual conditions and no turbulence was encountered prior to or after the event. A postflight examination of the airplane revealed that the extreme turbulence encountered resulted in substantial structural damage to both wings spars.  The pilot reported there were no pre-impact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.      Probable Cause: The airplane encountered extreme turbulence during descent."

        "details": "The aircraft broke up in-flight during a high speed descent after encountering clouds and reduced visibilities aloft.  The weather conditions included multiple cloud layers at 9,000, 12,000 and 16,000 feet, and reduced visibility aloft from smoke and haze from wilderness wild fires that were occurring over large portions of Southern California.  The aircraft departed the airport toward a VORTAC to the west, approximately 30 nautical miles (nm) away.  The first radar contact was at 1159, and the aircraft's Mode C transponder reported an altitude of 3,500 feet mean sea level (msl).  By the time the aircraft reached the VORTAC, the altitude had increased to 4,900 feet msl.  The aircraft continued to climb, passing through the VFR flight plan filed altitude of 8,500 feet msl, until it reached an altitude of 12,900 feet msl. The last 6 minutes of radar data reported the aircraft at various altitudes, starting at 11,000 feet msl and climbing to a maximum altitude of 12,700 feet msl.  During the last 3 minutes of flight, radar data showed the aircraft made numerous left and right climbing and descending turns, eventually reversing course.  The next to last radar return at 1221:24 indicated an altitude of 11,900 feet msl.  Nineteen seconds later, the last radar return reported an altitude of 7,700 feet msl.  The computed vertical speed between the last two radar returns was 13,263 feet per minute.  The wreckage was distributed over a 0.2-nm distance, with the main wreckage approximately 0.5 miles northwest of the last radar return.  The northern end of the debris path began with pieces of the left elevator, followed by sections of the right stabilizer and elevator, and more sections from both horizontal empennage surfaces.  Pieces of the vertical stabilizer, rudder, and both ailerons were also found along the debris path.  The southern 100 feet of the debris path contained the fuselage and both sets of wings, engines, and propellers.  The aircraft impacted the ground inverted.  The wings separated just outboard of the nacelles at the initial point of impact.  Examination of the wreckage showed that all structural failures were the result of overload. Probable Cause: The pilot's continued VFR flight into instrument conditions between cloud layers and with reduced visibility due to smoke that resulted in an in-flight loss of control from spatial disorientation, and the structural overload of the airframe during the subsequent high speed descent."

The airplane sustained substantial damage.  The pilot reported that after reaching a cruising altitude of 9,000 feet the engine \"missed\" and the oil pressure, oil temperature, and manifold pressure began to drop. The pilot attempted to fly to the nearest airport maintaining a 500 to 800 foot per minute descent. Unable to make it to the airport, he chose a field in which to land. He stated he cleared the trees, which surrounded the field, and applied flaps to slow the airplane. The field was muddy so the pilot used the emergency gear extension to lower the landing gear so the airplane would not slide into the trees. The airplane touched down and slid approximately 25 feet prior to coming to rest. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing and fuselage.  An engine teardown revealed holes in the crankcase near the number four cylinder and that the engine had sustained both thermal and mechanical damage as a result of oil starvation. A hole was noted in the turbine wheel shroud on the hot section of the right turbocharger.   Probable Cause and Findings The fatigue failure of the turbocharger shroud which resulted in oil starvation to the engine. A factor was the muddy field."

There was still runway remaining, and the pilot made the decision to abort the takeoff. Because the airplane was at a very low altitude, the pilot was not sure that all three landing gear would fully extend before the airplane touched down. Therefore, he elected to keep the landing gear retracted, and the airplane touched down on the soft/rough terrain adjacent to the runway. Although no anomalies related to the engine were found, three pieces of poly-isoprene (synthetic rubber) were found in the fuel tank associated with the engine that lost power. Each individual piece was large enough to plug the orifice to the fuel boost pump, and it is likely that one or more of the pieces interrupted the fuel flow to the engine and resulted in the loss of power. Probable Cause: The total loss of power in one engine during takeoff due to the blockage of fuel flow by a foreign object in the fuel tank."

He tried to regain directional control by applying full right brake and aileron and reducing power but to no avail. The airplane departed the left side of the runway. The right wing struck PAPI (precision approach path indicator) lights and the airplane came to a halt. The airplane was substantially damaged during th impact. Postaccident examination revealed an internal mechanical failure of the left wheel, causing the wheel to seize and the tire to roll off its rim. Sideloads caused the right main landing gear to fail. Probable Cause: The pilot's inability to maintain directional control due to an internal mechanical failure of the left wheel that caused the wheel to seize."

Approximately 30 to 35 minutes after takeoff, the airplane's engine began to sputter, which was followed by a total loss of power.  The airplane sustained substantial damage to the firewall and airframe during an ensuing forced landing to a field.  Examination of the airplane revealed that both fuel tanks were intact, however, they contained no fuel.  The pilot stated that he did not experience any mechanical problems with the airplane and attributed the loss of engine power to fuel exhaustion.  He reported 2,065 hours of total flight experience, which included approximately 292 hours in the same make and model as the accident airplane.  Probable Cause: The pilot's improper preflight planning, which resulted in a loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion, and subsequent forced landing to a field."

The airplane impacted the ground at a location consistent with the base leg of the airport traffic pattern. Impact damage, including crushing of the forward fuselage and right wing, and twisting of the tail, was consistent with a nose-down, right-wing-low impact. Damage to the right propeller indicated that the right engine was running at the time of the impact. The left engine and its propeller appeared to be intact. Examination of the left engine failed to reveal any defects that would have prevented normal operation. The damage to the left wing was not as severe as the damage to the right side of the airplane. No anomalies consistent with a preimpact failure associated with the airframe or engines were observed. Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed, resulting in an aerodynamic stall and spin. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's unfamiliarity with the airplane subsequent to float installation."

The airplane veered to the right and the pilot lost directional control of the airplane. The airplane went off the right side of the runway, collided with a ditch, and the nose wheel collapsed. Examination of the flight control system, brakes, and reverse thrust revealed no anomalies. Examination of the nose wheel steering revealed the steering clutches were not grounded, and the grounding stud for the clutches were loose. The nut was screwed on the screw about 3 turns. Pressure was applied to wire number 717-16N and a ground was obtained.  When the pressure was released no ground was obtained. The left side console wiring was required to have been inspected during the last Letter Check, \" B\" Inspection on December 17, 2002. No work sheets for the inspection were located. Review of the logbooks revealed no maintenance had been performed in this area. Probable Cause: The pilot's inability to maintain directional control due to the inadequate grounding of the nose wheel steering clutches, as a result of inadequate maintenance inspection by other maintenance personnel to ensure the nose wheel steering clutches were grounded.  A related factor was the ditch."

The commercial pilot was seriously injured, and his passenger was fatally injured in the accident.  The flight was en route on a return flight from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Atlanta-DeKalb Peachtree Airport, Georgia, when the engine lost power. The pilot reported that he had 18 gallons of fuel in the right fuel tank and more than 25 gallons in the left fuel tank when the power loss occurred. He indicated that he switched from the right to the left fuel tank position. The pilot called on the UNICOM frequency to report that he was low on fuel and needed assistance in finding an airport. The pilot of another airplane gave him the vectors to the Greenwood airport. The last radio transmission heard from the pilot was \"I'm over a four-lane highway…no more fuel.\" He later stated that instead of saying \"no more fuel,\" he should instead have reported that he had \"lost the engine.\" During the forced landing, the airplane struck two power lines and two utility poles and came to rest on its right side with the left wing in the near-vertical position. A power line penetrated the left wing, breaching the left fuel tank, but the left wing did not burn or explode. The fuel selector was selected to the left fuel tank. The right wing was separated from the fuselage, and the fuel tank was ruptured. A fire ensued. One witness stated that he saw fluid leaking from the left wing and onto the engine compartment. He stated that he assumed the fluid was aviation fuel because whenever it hit the engine compartment, the fire flared up. The second witness indicated that he smelled fuel and assumed fuel was sustaining the postcrash fire. When the airplane was turned upright, the day after the accident, less than 1 gallon of fuel was drained from the left fuel tank. The pilot reported that during his preflight inspection at the Peachtree-Dekalb Airport in Chamblee, he determined that the left and right wing fuel tanks each had more than 25 gallons of fuel. He added 15 gallons of fuel per tank for a total of 80 gallons. The airplane's total fuel capacity is 122 gallons, of which 120 gallons are usable. Safety Board staff calculated that the airplane burned 20 gallons of fuel per hour at 75 percent power. The total 2.2-hour flight was therefore calculated to have consumed about 44 gallons of fuel, not counting the fuel used to taxi, take off, and climb. The fuel remaining was therefore adequate to complete the flight. Examination of the engine did not disclose evidence of mechanical malfunction. At the time of the accident, the pilot had a total of 10 hours experience in this make and model airplane, all obtained over a period of about 4 years.  Probable Cause and Findings the loss of engine power for undetermined reason."

The private pilot and three passengers were not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight being conducted under Title 14 CFR Part 91.  The flight originated at Logan, Utah, approximately 1115.  In his accident report, the pilot said he made a normal approach to the landing zone from the north.  The landing zone was situated approximately 8,600 feet above mean sea level.  When the helicopter was about 200 meters (656 feet) from touching down, it entered an uncontrolled descent.  The pilot said he applied full collective that resulted in \"uncontrollable R (right, rotor) pitch.\" The pilot reversed direction \"accelerating R (right) rotation without pedal ability to control or correct.\"  The pilot \"grounded\" the left skid into the mountain side and the helicopter rolled over on its left side.  Asked how the accident could have been prevented the pilot wrote, \"Out of ground effect hover (test) attempt.\"  Because the pilot used numerous abbreviations in the narrative portion of the report, witness statements were reviewed for corroboration.  A ground witness and a back seat passenger said the helicopter spun (turned) to the left.  The front seat passenger and the other back seat passenger agreed with the pilot and said the helicopter spun (turned) to the right.  The ground witness said the pilot later told him \"he ran out of left pedal.\"  One of the rear seat passengers said the helicopter \"lost tail rotor.\"  The Federal Aviation Administration inspector who examined the wreckage reported he could find no evidence of a preimpact failure of the airframe, drive train, or flight controls.  According to AERODYNAMICS FOR NAVAL AVIATORS (NAVAIR 00-80T-80, c. 1960, rev. January 1965, p. 321), \"Directional control in a single rotor helicopter is obtained by a tail rotor (antitorque rotor) since a conventional aerodynamic surface would not be effective at low speeds or hovering.  The directional control requirements of the tail rotor on a typical shaft-driven helicopter are quite demanding since it must counteract the engine torque being supplied to the main rotor as well as provide directional control.  Being a rotor in every respect, the tail rotor requires some of the engine power to generate its control forces.  Unfortunately, the maximum demands of the tail rotor occur at conditions when engine power is also in great demand.  The most critical condition is while hovering at maximum gross weight.  The tail rotor effectiveness is determined by the rotor characteristics and the distance the tail rotor is behind the c.g.\" PROBABLE CAUSE:The pilot's failure to maintain directional control because he exceeded the helicopter's hover performance.  A factor was the high density altitude."

Instead of turning right toward the intended destination, the airplane began a left turn toward the runway.  The angle of bank increased to about 45 degrees.  The airplane then nosed down, and descended into snow covered terrain, about 200 yards north of the runway.  Examination of the engine revealed the number six cylinder head was fractured, and slightly separated from the cylinder barrel.  The area around the point of separation was blackened and oily.  Similar discoloration was noted on the inside of the engine cowl.  A metallurgical examination of the cylinder head revealed a fatigue fracture along a large segment of the thread root radius between the 5th and 6th threads.  The engine's cylinder compression is part of the operator's approved airworthiness inspection program.  The number six cylinder compression, recorded 121 hours before the accident, was noted as 60 PSI.  The last engine inspection, 27 hours before the accident, did not include a record of the engine compression.  CAUSE: A fatigue failure, and partial separation of the number 6 engine cylinder head assembly, the operator's inadequate progressive inspection performed by company maintenance personnel, and the pilot's inadvertent stall during a maneuvering turn toward an emergency landing area."

He added that the southerly approach to the airstrip required a correction for variable, easterly winds between 5 and 10 knots. He said that just before touchdown he elected to add engine power to avoid an area of rough terrain on the northern end of the site. The airplane ballooned, and landed about mid-length along the 1,500 foot-long, by 30 feet-wide airstrip. After touchdown, the pilot realized that he would be unable to stop the airplane before reaching the end of the airstrip, and he added full engine power to abort the landing, but the airplane failed to become airborne again. The airplane continued off the south end of the site, down an embankment, and into a creek bed. The airplane sustained structural damage to the wings, fuselage, and empennage. The pilot noted that there were no preaccident mechanical anomalies with the airplane.  Probable Cause: The pilot's delay in aborting the landing. A factor contributing to the accident was a variable wind."

        "details": "On May 11, 2023, at 1210 central daylight time, a Loehle Acft Corp 5151 Mustang, N91026, was involved in an accident near Hector, Minnesota. The airplane sustained substantial damage. The commercial pilot was uninjured. The airplane was operated under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a test flight.  The previous owner and builder of the owner made the required logbook entry for completing phase 1 flight testing, therefore the aircraft was still in phase 1 testing and would have been limited to the flight test area listed in the operating limitations of the airworthiness certificate (Within 25NM of Bateman Field, Chippewa Falls WI excluding C airspace). The entire accident flight occurred outside of the flight test area.  The accident pilot/current airplane owner recently overhauled the carburetors and modified the fuel system on the accident airplane. When he purchased the airplane, it was equipped with an airframe ballistic parachute. He did not like airframe parachutes, so he removed it from the airplane and installed a fuel tank in its space. He calculated that the weight of the parachute was equal to the tank and 2 gallons of fuel. Prior to the accident flight, he tied the tailwheel of the airplane to an anchor point at the departure airport and ran the airplane engine at a high-power setting for approximately 28 minutes to test the fuel system modification that he made. He also adjusted the ground adjustable propeller to obtain 6,200 RPM. After the ground run, he decided to test fly the airplane. During takeoff, the engine only attained 6,100 RPM. He stated that he felt and knew something was wrong. There was another aircraft close to the airport, so he radioed the other aircraft of engine issues and asked the other aircraft for its position from the airport. The other aircraft responded that it was about 3 miles from the airport. The accident pilot told the other aircraft to go ahead and land, and he would land behind him. As the accident airplane turned towards the runway, the engine quit, and the accident pilot was unable to attain the runway. The airplane touched down in a soft field about 250 feet from the end of runway 12. The accident pilot recovered the airplane and placed it in a hangar without the knowledge/permission from the National Transportation Safety Board or Federal Aviation Administration.  The airplane sustained substantial damage that included damage to the wing rib and lower spar cap at left main gear attach point.  Postaccident examination of the airplane by the Federal Aviation Administration revealed the front carburetor was out of its mounting flange and the clamp securing it was loose enough that it was able to be placed back in the flange and removed without loosening the clamp."

According to the FAA airport facility directory, runway 01/19 was 1,850 feet long, and soft gravel. However, 1,000 feet of northern portion of the runway was closed indefinitely.  The pilot recalled that about 500 feet down the 1,850 foot runway, and just before touchdown the airplane encountered, “a pretty rapid shift in the winds in both direction and velocity.” He reported that the airplane touched down momentarily, and then went airborne again. After the second touchdown, the speed did not decline as expected, and although the airplane did start to slow as it got a better grip on the gravel (which was wet from rain that had occurred earlier), he ran out of runway. He reported that the airplane overran the runway at a groundspeed of about 10 knots, went down a small embankment, had a propeller strike and the airplane sustained substantial damage when the left wing struck a post.  The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or anomalies during the flight that would have prevented normal flight operations.  The pilot reported that he considered going around, but due to the wind and terrain rejected the idea.   Probable Cause: The pilot’s unstabilized approach and a subsequent runway overrun while landing on a short runway in variable wind conditions."

The flight instructor was having the student practice landing approaches. With an airspeed of 60 to 65 knots, the student initiated a left base turn, lowering the collective, and adding aft cyclic for a normal approach to an open field.  During the turn, the instructor noted that the helicopter was descending faster than anticipated, and that \"the collective was too far down, the cyclic was too far back, and [the student] had a tight hold on both controls.\" The instructor attempted to regain control but could not move the collective or cyclic due to the student's grip on the controls.  The instructor said that no words were spoken as he struggled with the student for control of the helicopter for a period of 3 to 4 seconds. The helicopter landed hard, rolled onto its left side, and instantly caught on fire. Both occupants exited the right door. The helicopter was destroyed by fire.  Probable Cause: The student's inadvertent control interference, which the flight instructor was unable to overcome. A contributing factor was the instructor's poor crew coordination in his failure to verbally command the student to relinquish the controls and his inadequate supervision of the flight."

This corroborates the pilot's report of an in-flight engine fire during takeoff climb.  The fuel nozzle No. 16 location appeared shiny, lacked the sooting that neighboring fuel nozzle pigtail-to-fuel manifold b-nut connections exhibited; therefore, it was considered a possible fuel leak location.  The engine was removed and sent to GE for evaluation; a fuel system leak check was performed but the source/location of the fuel leak could not be identified.  The fuel pressure and nitrogen check pressure used during the leak tests were well below the fuel pressure the engine experienced during the event and was determined to be insufficient to replicate the leak.   A torque check of all the fuel manifold b-nut connections found four locations, all located on the left fuel manifold, which had very low torque values, less than 200 inch-pounds, when compared to the other b-nut connection locations and the required installation torque of 285 inch-pounds nominal.  One of the four low torque locations was fuel nozzle No. 16 that was identified as a possible leak source during the initial examination.  Detailed analysis of the fuel nozzle No. 16 pigtail-to-fuel manifold b-nut connection revealed evidence of galling and intermediate contact marks consistent with and indicative of misalignment and relative movement within the connection; none of the other low torque b-nut connection locations exhibited this type of surface distress.    Since the post-event fuel system leak checks performed by GE could not induce a fuel leak, the exact location/source of the fuel leak could not be determined by testing and observations.  However, the combination of low torque, misalignment between fuel nozzle No. 16 pigtail-to-fuel manifold b-nut connection, and sealing surface distress created the conditions by which there was insufficient sealing allowing fuel to leak during high engine power and high fuel pressures.  No other fuel nozzle locations had this combination of factors that would have allowed a fuel leak.  Probable Cause: An in-flight engine fire resulted from a fuel leak from fuel nozzle No. 16 pigtail-to-fuel manifold b-nut connection that contacted hot engine parts and ignited.  Contributing to the manifold fuel leak was the misalignment between fuel manifold female ferrule and fuel nozzle male bullnose sealing surfaces coupled with distress of the ferrule sealing surface."

Prior to the accident flight, which departed from a hard-surface runway, he serviced the airplane with fuel and performed a preflight check. He intended to perform water landings on an adjacent lake, and after takeoff he selected the gear-up switch but had forgotten to reset the circuit breakers.  Shortly after takeoff he felt a light airframe vibration and decided to expedite the landing. While circling the landing spot, and slowing the airplane for the approach, the gear misconfigured warning sounded. However, the pilot silenced the warning because his attention was diverted by the landing due to the vibration, so the gear remained extended as the airplane touched the water. The airplane then nosed over and sustained substantial damage.  The “before engine start” checklist in the pilot’s operating handbook states that the circuit breakers should be in. There is no reference in the handbook to pulling the circuit breakers to prevent accidental activation.  Probable Cause: The pilot’s failure to confirm the landing gear was configured for a water landing during the approach. Contributing to the accident was the pilot’s deviation from the airplanes operating procedures by previously pulling the landing gear circuit breakers, which resulted in the landing gear not retracting when commanded during takeoff."

        "details": "The pilot and both crewmembers of the helicopter recalled routine radio communication as the helicopter approached the destination airport. They established visual contact with two airplanes that had announced their positions in the traffic pattern; one on the downwind leg and one on short final. The airplanes were also identified by the traffic avoidance system onboard the helicopter. The pilot followed behind and north of the second airplane and continued to the west side of the airport to complete a landing at the helipad. During the descent, about 500 feet above ground level (agl), the pilot \"saw about 2 feet of white wing right outside.\" He \"pulled power\" and then felt contact with an airplane. The airplane's right wing separated before it departed controlled flight and descended to the ground, fatally injuring both occupants. The helicopter subsequently landed with minor damage and no injuries to the 3 occupants.   Interpolation of radar data revealed that the accident airplane departed from the same airport about 21 minutes prior to the accident and completed a right downwind departure, contrary to the established left traffic pattern. The airplane’s transponder appeared to be off for about 3 minutes after takeoff before transmitting the visual flight rules transponder code (1200) for the remainder of the observed flight; the transponder appeared to be on and functioning at the time of the collision. The airplane proceeded north of the airport before reversing course and returning to approach the airport from the northeast. The last target was observed about 1.2 nautical miles north of the airport on a track leading toward the west side of the landing runway at an altitude of 500 feet agl. About 25 seconds later, the helicopter passed northeast of the airport on a modified left base, about 500 feet above traffic pattern altitude (1,500 feet agl), crossed the final approach course, and turned parallel to and on the west side of the runway. Although only the helicopter was observed by radar at the time of the collision, extrapolation of the accident airplane’s previously observed targets and flight path placed the airplane at the accident site about the same time the helicopter was observed there. An analysis of the relative positions of the airplane and helicopter based on radar data indicated that the airplane remained below the helicopter pilot's field of view as the helicopter overtook the airplane from behind and descended upon it from above. Although the data indicated that the airplane would likely have been visible to the pilot of the helicopter, it is important to note that the onboard traffic avoidance system (TAS) did not provide the pilot with any alert of its presence because the system operated on line-of-sight principles. If an intruder aircraft’s antenna was shielded from the TAS antenna, the ability of the TAS to track the target would be affected. If a TAS equipped aircraft was located directly above an intruder, the airframe of one or both of the aircraft could cause the TAS’s interrogations to be shielded, depending on antenna location (either bottom or top-mounted).   All other airplanes in the traffic pattern were acquired visually by the pilot and crew as their positions were confirmed by the helicopter's onboard traffic avoidance system and the position reports provided by the pilots of each airplane. Because of the high-wing structure of the airplane, and its relative position and altitude, the helicopter's image was either blocked from the airplane pilot's view by the left wing, or was above and behind the airplane in the seconds before collision. Further, no radio position reports from the accident airplane were confirmed. The helicopter pilot’s unalerted detection of the airplane against a complex background of ground objects would have been difficult because of both the lack of apparent contrast between the airplane and the ground, its size in the windscreen, its relative lack of movement within the pilot’s field of view, and the position and angle of the sun. In addition, the helic Probable Cause: The inherent limitations of the see-and-avoid concept, which made it difficult for the helicopter pilot to see the airplane before the collision. Contributing to the accident was the airplane pilot’s non-standard entry to the airport traffic pattern, which, contrary to published Federal Aviation Administration guidance, was conducted 500 feet below the airport's published traffic pattern altitude and in a direction that conflicted with the established flow of traffic."

        "details": "The student and flight instructor were conducting touch-and-go landings. The student flew an approach that required slipping the airplane and maintaining a low engine power setting. During the climb after the touch-and-go landing, the airplane’s engine lost power about 200 ft above ground level. Theflight instructorstated that the engine’s rpm was decreasing and he decided to turn toward the airport area. Subsequently, the flight instructor initiated a forced landing to a field near the airport. During the landing sequence, the airplane struck and breached the airport’s perimeter fence and then nosed over; a postaccident fire ensued. The postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. During the examination of the airplane wreckage, the fuel selector was found in an intermediate position. Ground testing of a similar model airplane revealed that the engine could run several minutes with the fuel selector positioned in this intermediate position. The student and the instructor stated that the student switched the fuel selector about 9 miles from the airport per operator requirements to switch fuel tanks every 30 minutes. Because of the location of the fuel selector, the flight instructor could not visually confirm its position. It is likely that the student inadvertently positioned the airplane’s fuel selector in an intermediate setting, which restricted the engine’s fuel supply. Further, the engine’s low power setting during the approach allowed the engine to run for several minutes on the fuel remaining in the return line and operate until shortly after the completion of the touch-and-go landing. Subsequently, during the climb, when the engine power was advanced, it is likely that the remaining fuel in the return line was exhausted and led to the engine power loss.   Probable Cause: The student pilot’s inadvertent positioning of the fuel selector in an intermediate position, which resulted in a loss of engine power due to fuel starvation."

The engine then went to idle without pilot input, and the pilot performed a forced landing to a marsh. During the forced landing, the airplane nosed over and was substantially damaged.  Postaccident examination of the airplane found that the nut used to properly secure the throttle control to the fuel servo was loose. The associated cotter pin was not located. The pilot reported that the airplane's most recent maintenance occurred on April 1, 2021. The mechanic likely did not install the cotter pin at that time. The accident airplane flew about 438 hours between that date and the accident date. During that time, the nut likely loosened until the throttle control was no longer secured, resulting in a total loss of engine power during the accident flight.  Probable Cause: The mechanic's failure to properly secure the throttle arm rendering it loose and inoperable after takeoff, which resulted in a total loss of engine power."
